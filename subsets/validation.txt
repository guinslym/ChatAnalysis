Thanks , I will go there later. Okay. Have a great day You too. :)

Hello! hi how may i help you? I'm looking for a database that could help me with market sizing. I've seen a few in my business classes but I dont remember their names... did you check the descriptions provided on the business research guides?  I'll get you the URL in a sec I haven't found those yet. That would be great, thank you! http://guides.library.cmu.edu/businessdb if you just go to guides.library.cmu.edu you can browse all the business research guides .. there are some designed for particular classes, so you should check those as well If you still cannot find what you need, email Roye Werner our Business Librarian her email is rwerner@andrew.cmu.edu That's perfect! Thank you so much. you're welcome anything else I can help with? Nope, that's it! great .. enjoy your day and have a great weekend you too! thanks

hi Hi I'm checking to see if we (CMU student and faculty) have access to this report http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/collaborative-robot-market-194541294.html besides using the "search everything" function on the website, is there other ways I can search? Sorry, we don't.  It's not exactly cheap-$5,000-8,000, depending on what license you get.  That's the problem with these market research reports on the web, so expensive only businesses can afford them.  I'll send you alternatives next Are you in a Tepper class? If so, which one? I was in a Tepper class "Marketing Project 45-937". Now the class is finished, but I continue working with the professor in this project to do further market research. no problem.  Here sorry-that got away from me Here's a guide that the business librarian prepared on Market research, with the databases that are best for that kind of research.  You may not easily get to these particular resources when you do the kind of "search everything.":http://guides.library.cmu.edu/marketresearch The databases in Industry overviews might be the most helpful Do I need to go into each of the database to do the search? or there is a place that I can search all the databases at once? No, you can't search them all at once since they are from different db producers, have different interfaces, etc. Reading the descriptions may help you decide which ones to go into. Also, in some of the "bibliographic databases" (have articles, not data), like Businesss Source Premier, you may find synopsis or information from the market research report you first asked about. oh ok. Thank you for your help! I will look through these databases. I just did a search on "collaborative robots" forecast* and market* in Business source premier and got this: Collaborative robot report predicts 'phenomenal' growth. The article reports on the report "Global Material Handling Cobots Market by End-user, Application and Region-Analysis and Outlook 2016-2022," which expects a phenomenal growth for materials handling collaborative robots (cobots) in the industrial manufacturing. where is "Business source premier"? It's on our db list.  All the dbs listed on the guide, too, are in our db list.  Go to homepage, Search and Find, Research Databases, "b" for Business source premier. You can also sort all our dbs by subjects.   You might also consider the keyword "cobots." Lastly, you can always make an app't with the business librarian, Ryan Splenda. ah-ha, found it. Thank you! Let me try several of these databases to see what I can find. You're very welcome!

Hello,   one of the Heinz college faculty is trying to access the Web of Science while abroad.  Is this possible without a VPN? Hi Yes. If he goes to the Libraries' homepage www.library.cmu.edu and goes to Research Databases (under the search box) and also under "Search and Find" Go to W for web of science.  He'll be prompted for his Andrew user ID and psswd This is true for 99.99% of our databases-those that need the VPN have that info in the database description. Ok.  and using that portal will avoid the issues he had with 'roaming' while trying to access it from abroad? I'm not sure what you mean by "issues with roaming." When he attempted to login in with his Web of Science id and password, he was told he had not accessed it from his network and therefore had no access to 'roaming' Sorry, I don't know what that means.  All I know is that our databases are fit with a proxy that lets you login from anywhere as long as you have an Andrew user ID and Password.  Maybe the problem was that he was logging in with "his" WoS psswd.  To be authenticated, he needs to login with his Andrew user ID and psswd and then sign in if he's registered on WoS. Alright.   I will pass this information along and see if it solves his problem.   Thank you for your help. You're welcome. He can also email us directly if that will help huntref@andrew.cmu.edu But basically he'll get a login prompt for his Andrew user ID and psswd if not on a CMU IP address.  Once in WoS, he can login to use the special features (saved searches, etc.), assuming he registered to use them and that's what he means by loggin in with his WoS ID and psswd.

Good morning.  I'm looking for a scientific illustration of Ammophila breviligulata (American Beach Grass).  How can I access your HIBD collection to see if one exists? one  moment The library you want is the Hunt Botanical Library. It is a part of Carnegie Mellon University but not part of the University Libraries. Here is the url for the library you need to contact them for access. http://www.huntbotanical.org/ Thank you! you are welcome I'm sorry ... just a bit confused:  http://huntbotanical.org/databases/show.php?3  Paragraph 3 seems to say it can be accessed through you?  Is that correct? you can search in CAMEO we do catalog some of their material. When I have tried that it eventually asks for an ID and password.  I have neither.  Is this only for students and researchers?  I'm just the general public. You should be able to search our catalog may I asked how you are accessing out catalog Online.  When I get to a citation it has a button that says: Get It @ CMU.  When I click on it it asks for an ID & password. unfortunately the get it button is only for CMU staff, faculty, students  I get it ... just kidding. It would be best if you contact the Hunt Botanical directly and talk with them Thank you.  Have a great day! You have one also

Hello, I'm a first year MBA student at the Tepper School, and I was hoping to get some help on tracking down some market research on the athletic apparel/activewear industry.  I've searched IBISworld but I can't find anything relevant.  Can you point me in the right direction?  Thanks sure - I can help yoy you Have you looked yet at this guide to industry research?  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries?  Yes that is where I started and led me to IBIS world Is there link in particular from that site that I should check out? It seems to be hard to delineate sports apparel from sporting goods and regular clothing You might try these terms:  "active sportswear", "athletic footwear" -  but as far as databases, your best bets from that list are probably:  Passport, RKMA, Statista, and Just- Series (Style) Okay, I will check those out.  Thanks! If you give me your email I'll send you some more ideas later Sure, msbandi@tepper.cmu.edu Thanks again you're welcome

hi hi I have a question Ok-shoot! I found a book here but I can't find a link to read the contents of the book could you provide it to me? Can you give me the title of the book or the URL of the record from the catalog? Object-oriented databases : technology, applications, and products this is the title OK-just a minute please If this is the records you saw http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/451816 please note that this is a paper book in the SEI Library so I can't find it here? No, there is only one copy and it's at the Software Engineering Library on 5th Ave (across from St. Paul's Church) and its no available online? We don't offer it online.  We only have the one paper copy Note it's from 1994. oh ok thanks for that note You're welcome. We may have some more current articles on the topic if that's what you want. that would be useful You could just search the "Articles and More" on the homepage, or go to the Databases (under search and find) and use the subject option to limit to your subject (e.g. computer science) What ;might be helpful, too, is a database we just got called Safari Books Online: Thousands of best-selling, top-rated IT, computing, technology and business books by leading authors. Please make sure that you logoff when done - this is a limited access resource. I just searched "Object-oriented databases" and lots of chapters came up-you'll get the text online I would like to get some articles that contains products of object oriented databases I added products to my search in Safari books and came up with some chapters.  Is this for business? I did an advanced search in our ABI database (a  more business oriented db) with Object-oriented databases on one line (in quotation marks to get exact phrase) and products on next.  got over 600 hits.  You can sort by relevancy (default) or date. I have to do a research about object oriented databases and my professor would like me to ad information about products that use object oriented databases ok I will try that now Are you a tepper student? yes If you don't find what you want in that search, contact the business librarian-Roye Werner rwerner@andrew.cmu.edu and she'll be able to help you. ok thanks a lot You're very welcome-have a good day! :-) and a Happy Thanksgiving! same to you! Thanks! :-)

Hello, I am trying to check out an ebook but I keep getting asked for an ANDREW login which I dont have. I enter my library card number but that is not sufficient. Can you help please?  Hello! Hi! Can you give me a bit more information about the e-book? Sure it's called Security policies and implementation issues by Rob Johnson and it has etext Okay, just a moment! thanks It seems to be available on our Safari platform.  Are you currently on campus or off campus? I am off campus.  What is Safari - do you mean the browser? No--Safari is an e-book platform that provides us access to a lot of our ebook collection.  You should be able to access this if you go through the library website.  Did you try that yet? I believe so - I went through CMU Libraries - here is the URL it's at: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1711793/Holdings#tabnav That's correct--when you click on the "Connect to this resource online", you may be prompted for your Andrew login, as you mentioned.  When you say you don't have one, are you a current student/faculty/staff at CMU? No but I have a library card.  I have checked out many other online books from CMU with it Can I ask what your affiliation with CMU is?  Did you obtain a guest library card from an affiliation with an organization? In other words, is it a 'special patron library card'? I don't know that it's a "guest" card - I am the Chair of the Postal Customer Council for the USPS and we work with CMU on a lot of programs so that is how I initially was referred to receive it. My number is 11812017038485 if that help!  *helps!  I could be wrong, but that looks like a Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh card number.  Is it possible you're confusing the public library with the university library system?    Oh gosh I'm sorry - I guess that's what it is... I didn't realize it was different actually, I thought it was under CMU.  No, CMU is a private university.  You'll want to check with the public library at http://www.carnegielibrary.org/. ok thanks for your help!  No problem!  Have a great day!

Um, may I ask how long does it take to borrow ? I checked and nearby libraries do not own  so you would want to request it via the following:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting how long it takes, depends on where we borrow the book from  If this is for particular research, we can request to purchase the book for CMU's collection  Oh, this is for research but I need to think more about it. Thanks for your help, I will ask you when I need help. Thanks for your consideration.  ok you can also email us at sciref@andrew.cmu.edu--should you have problems obtaining the book from Interlibrary Loan or would like us to purchase on behalf of particular dept research. 

good morning, is this something that can be checked out or does it have to be kept in the library for viewing   http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/481416 Hi I believe videos from the 2nd floor need to be viewed onsite-let me get you the policy. http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/filmvideo/vidcoll

One of the on-line resources I've been tapping that CMU doesn't seem to possess has an "OpenAccess" link, acknowledging CMU, but asking for an ID and password.  My Andrew/library ID/pw doesn't work. hi which resources is that? Treatise on Geochemistry (2nd ed).  Multiple volumes, each with multiple chapters.  Each says I can purchase a copy (thank$) or go through my institution's "OpenAccess".  I've been using ILLIAD but if I can get direct access, it's much more efficient. It is possible that we have a subscription to the resource but not that particular item.  Let me check. ok http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080959757006148 we have this on science direct .. but at a different link Please direct me It seems that we only have access to the first edition - http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/referenceworks/9780080437514  No good.  Am I stuck routing through ILLIAD then? wait I found the second edition ..  here - http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/referenceworks/9780080983004 does this work? I'll try it.  It's still asking me for ID/password hmm.. you're off campus? Way off.  California. try going to science direct (under research databases) and search by title ..  Do I have to use VPN? I don't think so .. though we're experiencing problems with CAMEO ... so we have to find other ways to access some items Thanks.  I'll try the "research databases" route.  (End of chat.) here's the link to the database .. let me know if you are able to or not http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journals sorry use the book browser - http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookbshsrw  update ... I just double checked .. we do not have rights to this book .. I'll let our sciences librarian know (Diane Covington) her email is dianec@andrew.cmu.edu, if you wish to recommend the purchase yourself Say "hi" to Diane for me.  Paul J. Karol Great .. will do .. enjoy the warm/er weather in the mean while. There would be limited interest in this outside of me, so it's not a justifiable library expense.  (I'm a Republican.) ah .. ok .. well .. ILL then :) Bye

I am a Pitt student and am a member of CMU library hi I am loggedin right now and am trying to access the book http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1572530 what do you mean, you are a member of CMU library?  you purchaed membership?

Thanks so much. Appreciate it. are you sure it's not available at PITT? no problem I checked. it is not available got it .. anything else?

Hi, what is the benefit to listing my dissertation in ProQuest? it seems to only, potentially, restrict rights Others who have access to the database will be able to search by subject, author, keywords, etc. and locate it. it's CMU Research Showcase + making available on the internet probably "good enough" ? that's up to you. I'll send you a link with info that may help http://www.library.cmu.edu/datapub/sc/dissertation/decisions Do you want people to discover your dissertation when they search the open web using an Internet search engine such as Google, or do you prefer that discovery of your work be more restricted, for example, via a search of a library catalog, Dissertation Abstracts International, or the Dissertations & Theses Database? If you want to encourage easy discovery by the broadest possible range of readers, then enable your work to be discovered in a search of the open web. ok, thanks! You're welcome!

Hello! I'm trying to access this publication: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-proquest_miscellaneous_1281218283 Is it only available on campus wifi or campus VPN? Hello! Just a moment while I check on this for you. Thank you! Just to clarify, are you interested in access to the journal as a whole?  Or specifically the article that the link pointed to called "Personals"?   I'm interested in the entire journal, but also that specific article about Phipps. Hmmm...I'm also having a hard time getting access to the journal content--I'm not quite sure what the problem is.  Just a moment while I investigate. I'm afraid I'm not sure what's going on here, and will have to get in touch with our e-resources team.  Are you able to provide your email address so that I can follow up with you? Okay, thanks so much for looking into this. My email address is hrn@andrew.cmu.edu. Great--I'll be in touch soon. Also, do you happen to have a full citation for the document you're looking for?  If not, I'll just work from the link you sent. Unfortunately not. I was going off of the library's search tool and came across that article. This is the citation the link gives me: New publications. (1894, Aug 11). American Gardening (1892-1904), 15, 361. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/128143124?accountid=9902 Thanks!  I'll be in touch soon! Great, thanks so much!

I can check one moment http://www.netadvantage.standardandpoors.com/NASApp/NetAdvantage/loadIndustrySurvey.do?task=loadIndustriesPage have you already checked the database?

I am an alumn but don;t have this access.  Yes unfortunately you would need to have current CMU account but let me check other options for you...one moment I have 2 suggestions:  1.  Contact the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh to see if they have latest surveys:  http://www.carnegielibrary.org/research/business/databases.html 2. Contact our Business Librarian http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper Roye's contact info is on the link that I just forwarded to you http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper rwerner@andrew.cmu.edu Good ideas. I tried Carnegie but their subscription doesn't have surveys. I will try Roye. If I cannot access remotely, I presume you have print copies at Hunt. Is that right?  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/360021 |a CMU has access to the online version through a subscription to NetAdvantage. 
590 			|a Volumes held: 1973-Apr. 2008. 1973-1999 weekly or monthly issues are kept in looseleaf binders, by industry, in offsite storage. Quarterly volumes are in offsite storage.

hello i am looking to speak with somebody regarding the use of your bloomberg terminal for research

Hi, this is Geonu Kim, a phd candidate of MSE. I want to ask questions about requesting items. Now I research contact lens materials, and find that "Contact lens practice" (3rd edition, Author: Nathan Efron) is a great book for me. How can I request this item? Should I use ILLiad or E-Z Borrow? Hi Geonu! Thanks for contacting us with your question You have already double-checked to make sure that we don't have this book already? Okay, I have checked our holdings and it looks like we do not have it E-Z Borrow would potentially get you the book faster as it searches Pennsylvania institutions for this book You would log into E-Z Borrow, search for the book, and place the request This can be done here: http://library.cmu.edu/using/requesting ILLiad would take a little longer because we would do the searching for you across the country and try to get the book to you that way You would also log into ILLiad, fill out a form with citation information for the book and place the request that way The same link has ILLiad information Are you still there, Geonu? Additionally, you may want to reach out to the Liaison Librarian for MSE to see if she could possibly add the book to our collection. Her name is Donna Beck, and her contact info is here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/donna-beck Hi I am here okay If E-Z borrow does not work. I will contact with her  Sounds good THanks for contacting us!

Hello, does library have access to Wall Street Journal? Yes.  Go to the homepage, Search and Find, Research Databases, then W for WSJ Libraries homepage is www.library.cmu.edu Thanks a lot!

Do the libraries keep any sort of record of all of the books written by alumni and faculty/staff? Hello? hello sorry .. was on the phone the library doesn't keep a record for all the books published by alumni, faculty or staff .. however if you have a list for specific authors, you can find out what we have by searching by author FYI, we generally acquire all publications by faculty, if that helps.

I would like to get access to the following, and don't know how: http://www.annualreviews.org/journal/statistics Hi! Let me look into this for you... one minute Annual Reviews can be found under the research databases on the CMU homepage, going through the website should help you connect if you cannot currently But I want to download articles. Will I be able to? We do seem to have access to the database, but I would need to know the article to tell if it's possible to download. Do you have a particular one you are looking for? http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-statistics-010814-020335 You're right, it doesn't appear that we have a subscription for the article. You could do an Interlibrary Loan request to get a copy of it; have you ever used ILL before? Not worth it, thank youo

I'm interested in borrowing this book on CD is it available to check out or is this an item that cannot leave the library? A walk in the woods [rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail] /

Hi - Was wondering about the catalog information for the video "The Building of Mellon Institute" narrated by Paul Long which is a video in the CMU collection - wondering when it was recorded Hello. The video was "published" in 1982 per the catalog record.  You may be able to confirm that with the University Archives. Oh it was originally recorded long before that. I think.  I saw it back in the late 80's being shown on 16 mm film in the Mellon Institute auditorium when I was a student...1982 was probably when it was transferred to tape. You should contact the University Archives. They probably can provide more information. http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/julia-corrin Thanks very much - I may try to contact the archivist....if I recall correctly, I remember hearing that it was one of Paul Long's first voice projects when he was a young man in his 20s which would have been sometime around late 1930s or early 1940s You are welcome. Thanks again and have a nice evening!

can you please let me know of the contact person for the leadership library database? Hi I'll be glad to help you with that. thank you. I am a staff member with OSP and looking to see if I can use the export options available through this resource You should be able to. I can't right now since it says I don't have the credits needed for exporting records.   Oh-I see what you mean-I just tried and saw that.  Let me check into this further Thank you! You're welcome. You're the first person to ever report this, so sorry I don't know off the top of my head! No issues.. Can you please direct me to the contact for the leadership library to see if it's included in our subscription or if we should contact them separately?  Thanks! It appears our account is read only.  I'm seeing what it will take to be able to export. It would cost about $2,000 to get some download credits.  I don't think that's going to be possible. Is it possible to attach the credits with a user and have us pay for it? Let me ask. Well, I will need to talk to their "relationship manager" to see if this is possible.  Or would you rather they talk to you? I also think at this point our acquisitions librarian should be informed as to what you want.   I can talk with them, but thought I should let the libraries know that I'm doing that.. Please let me know of next steps.   Yeah, we need to know when stuff like this happens. Can you tell me your name and email?  I'll send an email to our acquisitions librarian and give her the heads up, copying you. That would be great! sumitha@andrew.cmu.edu; 82841 Thansk again! Thank you! You're welcome! Can I ask what you'd like to download, just to make sure we have no other way to get the info? Federal agency hierarchies  Ok....that would probably be the best source for that.  I'm in touch with the relationship manager.  I'm trying to get a sense of how many credits a download would take. Thank you!  I also need to know if they have any sort of identifiers for the agencies, so it would be great if there is any way that I could talk with her directly.. For help with searches, you may want to use the direct chat on the database. They will be the best in terms of searching expertise, etc. ok. Thanks!  I forwarded you some info re credits via email.

hi, I am a postdoc at CMU. It seems that this paper is available through CMU's library. However, the link take me to page where full text is not shown Hello. Can you send me the title or link to the record? sure,  Effects of localised, low-voltage pulsed electric fields on the development and inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms OK. Let me check. Do you have more citation information? sure Is it in Biofouling? yes http://dx.doi.org.proxy.library.cmu.edu/10.1080/08927010601053541 http://search.proquest.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/docview/19876498?pq-origsite=summon We do not have access to the full-text. You could request it through interlibrary loan. Ok thanks, I will How does it take usually to receive it? It's hard to say. It depends on how quickly it's processed at both ends. ok thanks and have a good day bye bye

Good morning! I am trying to find a record of a relative attending Carnegie Tech in the 1920s. Any suggestions? Hi You can contact the University Archivist, Julia Corrin.  Give me a moment and I'll pass on her contact information. jcorrin@andrew.cmu.edu

Hello, I'm looking for literature about stakeholder analysis, specifically within the context of international development. I have been able to find generic writeups (http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/enyclopedia-of-action-research/n293.xml) and some targeted guides (http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1572547), but nothing within the development context. What would be good places to look? Hi there Interesting topic!  But hard to answer over chat - there is a lot to suggest, and we would like to understand better exactly what you're looking for. I could give you a list of databases and perhaps some subject headings for books, but you might waste a lot of time wading through them.  Would you consider making an appointment with our liaison librarian in that area? Sure, thanks. In person might be easier.

Hello, I need an article for my research. I was wondering whether you can help me access the article or not?  hi what is the article? also what is the journal title? Article name is: A review of fault detection and diagnostics methods for building systems Journal title is: science and technology for the built environment  I searched for it but could not find it online through cmu library website yes, we don't have a subscription to it .. have you tried ILLiad? i haven't. i actually don't know how that works. sorry for my ignorance  no worries .. I'll take you through the process thanks! from the library website http://library.cmu.edu click on Using the Library (top) you'll find "borrowing and renewing" as an option .. click on that select requesting materials then "request using ILLIad" since you haven't used it before, you'll be asked to register with your Andrew ID (this is a one time process).  Once you do, you can fill out a form for the article (link on left) the request takes a few days and they'll send an email with a link to the article.  Be sure to download asap (you have 3 days to recover before the link disappears - copyright regulation) That's really helpful! Thank you very much.  you're welcome .. anything else? That's all, thank you Have a nice day! :)  you too

Hi. I have a question about an article on EBSCOhost. hi Sure-ask away! I found an article that I'd like to read, and it says "For access to this entire article and additional high quality information, please check with your college/university library, local public library, or affiliated institution." Are you coming in on a CMU IP address?  and can you send me the citation? Yes, I'm on the CMU network now. And here's the page:  http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=eds&scope=site&jrnl=00012505&AN=21489891&h=p8ojDgTz25mLEtPl4J%2f86zfAUGKoYzTVsDcvoE2LFrNnW0vox%2bp0QW8edSwoCq%2bDwUzsmlj6wPJVrbTSmFK79g%3d%3d&crl=c&resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&resultNs=Ehost&crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00012505%26AN%3d21489891 Thx!  Just a minute. I'm curious how you got to EBSCOHOst. EBSCO has several dbs, and we have them individually listed on our database list.  When you go in that way, you should get a link to the full text if we provide or a link to a get it button, that lets you see retrieval options. I'll look for the full text for this. I made it to that page through a Google scholar link Ah....I see.  If you go to our e-journals list (it's under search and find on the libraries' homepage or go to this link: http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals) andcopy and paste in ASHRAE Transactions you'll see the full text options. You can get to this via Google Scholar if you configure GS:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/tools/gscholar I should say you can get to full text links!  I'll try those. Thanks for your help! You're welcome! :-) Have a good day :-) You too!

Hello,  hi there is a book I would like to check out, it appears to be available as an e-text but I could not see how I can find the link to it yes.

Dear librarian at Carnegie Mellon! I have a question regarding a technical report that dates back to 1995. hi what is the title of the report? "Network interconnection architectures and translational tilings" by Fiduccia, Zito, Mann Ok, and did you look anywhere for it? i found it in your catalog i am writing from germany, somewhat desparately trying to find a copy of that report i was hoping that you might be able to help me with it ok .. it's in our off-site storage .. are you a CMU faculty, staff, or alum? i am neither of those i am a postdoctoral researcher at a university in Berlin and not affiliated with CMU in any way is there any possibility for me to obtain a digital copy of the report? I am not sure .. we may have digital copies of it.  I'll forward your request to our science reference librarians.  One question: Does your university in Berlin offer a borrowing service? you could ask a librarian at your library to request it .. but it would have to be sent digitally, I think. Would you please provide your name and email so we can follow up? there is a borrowing service for sure, but i am not aware of a cooperation with CMU. I'll ask them about it. a digital copy is all i need sure Matthias Henze, matthias.henze@fu-berlin.de Ok Matthias .. I'll forward your email to them and you should hear from them  thanks you so much! if that's all, have a great day. yep that's all. same for you! bye

I need to borrow the book Hi  QA279 .F435 2014 Okay, let me take a look, one moment please  QA279 .F435 2014Optimal Design for Nonlinear Response Models, Okay, I have the record in front of me.  Were you able to find it at Sorrells Library? No at sci &amp; engineering library at CMU Can I reserve this book online? And pick it up later today? Okay, as you have no doubt noticed, we recently moved most of the book collection to offsite storage.  I looked up the checkout history of the book, and based on recent checkouts it should have remained at Sorrells.  Many books there still need to be unpacked from boxes to be placed on the bottom shelf of the stacks there.  Best bet is that it is in one of those boxes.  Are you able to stop by the Library to let the circulation desk know that you are looking for this book? Unfortunately, you are not able to reserve it online. Sorry, just to clarify - did you mean you are not at Sorrells Library or that you could not find the book there? I can't read the beginning of this latest msg did you mean you are not at Sorrells Library or that you could not find the book there? No I find thet the book is available at  Engineering &amp; Sci library. I thought I'd go to this library to borrow it Okay, please go to Sorrells Library and look for the book there. If you are not able to find it there in the stacks Where is Sorrells library? then please let the circulation desk know It is in Wean Hall, 4th floor Sorrells is the Engineering and Science Library Ah Ok. I didnt know. I thought I could reserve the book now, online and pick it up at some convenient time. Especially if it needs to be found from storage Yes, understand.  Unfortunately, we do not have that capability.   Ok, but if the book needs to be found from storage how long will it take. I'd need the book today or at least tomorrow Unfortunately, that will take a few days. However, based on recent checkouts, there is a good chance it is at the Library i.e. that it was not sent to storage I am not at the Library right now, so I am not able to check Saturday  i'm going out of tow to see one of my collaborator. We would need to be able to check some things on that book Can I get in touch with someone in the library? I'll see if I can get a number for the circulation desk, one moment please Thanks call 412-268-7217 that is the number for the circulation desk at Sorrells Library Thanks I'll call the circul desk Great, they should be able to see if the book is there

Hello. I can't login to Gartner with my Andrew ID OK - I'll check on that I got this error message: "An error occured during Federation with Gartner. Please contact your administrator" let me first see if it's working from here - it's fine from here.  So - 2 questions:  are you on or off campus? And - on what page did you get the link to Gartner? off campus from library.cmu.edu -> Research Databases -> Gartner Core Research http://search.library.cmu.edu/link/https://ssofed.gartner.com/sp/startSSO.ping?PartnerIdpId=https://login.cmu.edu/idp/shibboleth that should do it - does it take you to the CMU Web Login page? Yes... it does. And I type my andrew id / password... but then I got this error. Are accounts deactivated from Gartner? They shouldn't be - there must be some problem with the EZProxy.  In the meantime, you can use the VPN as an alternative.  Have you used that before? Yes.. I have. mmm let me try it.. Thank you. you're welcome - let us know if you have any problems Thanks... have a nice day. you too!

Thank you, Lynn Topar one moment You need to comtact Julia Corrins art jcorrin@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-7402.

Hi, I haven't been on the library site for a while, and it looks like it's changed!  I'm trying to find the dissertation of one of my alumni.  What is the best way to search that?  Thanks! hi hi If you're looking for dissertations, you should consider either the Dissertation and Abstract database  or Disssertations and Theses @ CMU databse (just for those done at CMU) Both databases will often have the entire PDF of the dissertation OK. I wasn't able to find the links to those. they are under Search and Find, then Research Databases OK, thanks! You're very welcome!

Greetings! Hi I am trying to access this article through the CMU system: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3007226 I am having trouble locating it through the CMU portal Ok-give me some time and let me see what I can do! Thank you for your help! If I'm going about using the system in the wrong way, please let me know Uh...I hate to say it, but if you brought up one page, with a picture of the man, I think that's the whole article. It's basically announcing that he's giving the keynote address 9/30/2016 on BEYOND CODE: PROGRESSING FROM PLAIN TEXT TO
BLOCKS BASED COMPUTING *
Jens M_nig

HARC, Y Combinator Research The citation indicates it is one page 5-5 If you give me your email, I'll be happy to send it to you. Thank you for the information! I am trying to find where you're looking at that single page Your welcome!  Citation Oh-let me explain This is the other piece I am trying to find through the CMU system http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2844661 On your link, under the title, you'll see the icon for PDF-that is where the one page is. This is the same with the other link you sent-it is a 2 page article.  Clicking on the PDF icon under the title (left hand side) brings up the PDF of the article. Ah - this may be the source of my confusion. When I click on the PDF link, it just launches the same webpage again Ok-how are you getting to the citations? Are you using the ACM link from our pages or from a search on our website? ACM link from our pages, but I am off campus, connected via VPN Well, via VPN, you should be getting access. With VPN, did you select Library Resources? this page has more detailed instructions: http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/offcampus If you don't use VPN, you should get prompted to login with your Andrew user ID and password. Yes, I'm on VPN and it auto logged me in I think I just got the links to work as you described, though I think the issue is that I loaded the pages before I was logged in After I refreshed the pages, it seems to have taken my credentials Oh...no..that won't work! You have to have authenticated somehow before you'll see the pages Excellent!! Makes a lot of sense... thanks for working with me on it Happy to hlep!! Have a good one! oops-help!! LOL! You aw well! :-) OK...I can't type! Have a great weekend! You too! Thx!

Hi, I want to schedule an appointment with a librarian, however I am not sure what subject area to select. The research is for my BXA Capstone project which is the use of Information Systems in HigherEd, specifically Residential/Student Life & Housing. Which subject area/librarian should I schedule time with? By the way, my name is Aamer. Hello. That's a good question! Let me see what I can find out. There is not an Information Systems librarian. However, depending on your focus in the area, maybe I can suggest someone. Can you tell me anything else about your project? So, I was wondering if there was anybody who would know more about the HigherEd side of the project, even if they didn't really know much about Information Systems The project has two parts, researching the industry and what is already available, and then developing a potential solution. OK. You may want to start with Roye Werner, the business librarian. http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/roye-werner Thank you! I will schedule time with her! Should I just use the appointment request form or email her? Either works. Ok, thank you for your help! You are welcome.

I searched for a paper in the library. hi And it turned up a successful result. Hello! - Sorry if the message was too direct, I don't want to waste too much of your time.  no, no problem-we will be happy to help.  Not sure what you're question is? But then I click the get it@CMU button and it takes me to a page that says no electronic holdings were found for this journal.  Did you do an "everything" search?  We may not have all the journal articles that are included in that search. If you give me the citation I can double check for you. Specifically, I was looking for "The Coroner's Strategies for Announcing Death" Just a minute-let me check. Although I'd happily accept another good example paper for writing a grounded theory research paper. So in summary I have two questions. 1. Why does the search some times turn up a get it at cmu button but then when I click on it, it doesn't link me to the document? This has happened multiple times before and I'm wondering if the links break and need to be reported as broken or if the search result doesn't mean that CMU has the document and I am misreading it some how. We actually have the full text of Coroner's Strategies for Announcing Death. Put the title in the everything search box. in the results click on Full text. 2.  Can you get me a good example of ground theory research paper?  The CMU button "get it" gives retrieval options, not necessarily full text. I'm assuming that the paper I want is a good one but I'm not sure. Is this for interp. and arguement? So I would be fine receiving the paper or another one. not sure what that means. What class is this for? Is this for English, Interpretation and Arguement? I'm a computer science student so I'm working a little outside my expertise on this project and would like the help of an example haha. No. It's not for that class. I'm a PhD student trying to write a new computer science theory. OK, thank you.  Is this for a particular class?  If so, what one? OK, now I understand. It's not for a class.  I want to publish the paper. publish the new paper I am writing* Maybe this will help: http://www.groundedtheoryonline.com/ http://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/9780335244492.pdf If these do not help, you may want to talk to the computer science librarian, Jillian Miller jillianc@andrew.cmu.edu
+1 412 268 6330 Thanks!  I'll look into them. What about the question on the get@CMU link? for the* I thought I answered that.  cmu link will give you retrieval OPTIONS.  If the full text is there, there will be the term full text.  CMU Link can show you if the article is full text in other databases, and it can also provide the link to our catalog and our interlibrary loan service.  It will not necessarily have the full text all the time. In the example you gave with the coroner article, there was a "full text" link next to the @cmu.  Clicking on that gave me the full text of the article. Ah, I see thanks! I had clicked on the citation option without realizing the full text was separate. It can get complicated , but just remember @CMU link is retrieval options. Whenever you see full text-click on that! And if you don't see full text, click on the @CMU get it link Thanks for the help!  You're very welcome! Have a good day. You as well-and good luck with your paper!! :-) Thanks!  One other question I thought about. Sure If I find a link that says it is supposed to take me to the full text, but then it asks me to log in to access the full text, should I report that? Or do something else? I don't have the log in information for that website. It wasn't asking for CMU credentials. yes, report it to use.  Sometimes db vendors remove the full text of journals. If you are using the databases/resources from our website, the only login should be with your Andrew user ID and password and that is if you are not on a CMU IP address (offcampus, or using laptop) We don't have db passwords to even give you-all our authentication for databases, online journals, etc, is either via IP authentication, or login with Andrew user ID and psswd, or using the VPN. Will do.  Who should I report that to? Remember, you can't just do a google search and then expect to be able to access the full text of an article from a journal (unless it's open access). You need to start with our Library website www.library.cmu.edu and either use the research database links, or the e-journal list. You can report it here, or you can send mail to any of the ref units- Hunt Library   at huntref@andrew.cmu.edu  or sciref@andrew.cmu.edu for the science libraries Thanks. I'll remember to check that before filing a report. You're welcome.  and we'll be happy to double check any access issue for you. Have a good day! You as well! :-)

Hello, Hello May I ask something about the website? Of course. I don't know why I can't see the position of a book any longer, is that information supposed to be shown under "holdings"? We are currently experiencing some problems with our catalog. Holdings information is not displaying. I might be able to use a workaround if you'd like to share the title with me. Oh, I see. Unfortunately, all the books I'd like to search have already been marked "checked out"... That is also another bug. ??? ALL books are displaying as checked out. As a sit in my office and look at the book stacks, I can tell you that is not the case! So there is a good chance the books you want are available. Sure, then could you help me check the book "NUMERICAL ANALYSIS" from Burden, which will be better if it's the 10th edition with ISBN 9781305253667 OK - just a second I think we have the 2005 - 8th edition. Sounds good! May I learn where it is in case I need it sometime during the semester? It's located in the Stacks at Sorrells Engineering & Science Library. Call number QA297 .B84 2005. Staff is working to get the catalog back in working order. I suggest you try to look the title up again prior to going to the library. So how soon may I expect the catalog will be fixed?  I am sorry but I can't answer that question. Hopefully very soon. Alright. One last question... Could you help search the book "Introduction to Operations Research" by Hillier and I think there is the lastest version Sure. Just a sec It looks like the 2015 edition is checked out. You could try requesting it through interlibrary loan. When the catalog is working again, you can place a hold on the library copy. Ha, that's not a bug then~ No -- that one is really checked out! Where can I find the relatively new versions?  It looks like that's it. The Libraries has 2001 but in Qatar, And much earlier editions 1995 edition is in Hunt Library, STACKS-3. Call number T57.6 .H53 1995 Cool! Great thanks for your patient and detailed help!!! Have a good one~ You are very welcome. Good luck. And I apologize for the inconvenience.

Hi: I need to access ISI (thompson reuters index of science) off-campus. But, I can't find the link to do so...used to be on the old site. Can you point me in the right direction? Hi I think you mean Web of Science-look under W and see if Web of Science is the one you mean. yes, sorry, that's what I meant. where do I go to look under W though? That's what I can no longer find No problem. Oh-from the libraries' homepage, go to Search and Find, and then Research databases.

Do you need help on how to do that? yes, that would help ok .. go to the link for scifinder from Research Databases  ok, i'm there when you click on it .. you get a screen that asks you to log in, right? yes see "forgot my password"?  Click on it and give them your email and select a password .. they'll create a temporary one for you alone .. use that to log in ignore "user name" since you don't have one yet ..  just give them your email address it replied "Email not found. try another e-mail, or contact us for assistance" urgh.... ok .. hold on ..

I have a question about business research. I'm trying to figure out about energy usage of water heaters in the retail industry. Do you have suggestions on finding this information? Hi Hello I just want to make sure I understand you-are you talking about retailing (selling) water heaters and their energy use? Not really. More about how retailers' energy usage. Eg. how much of Walmart's energy bill is used by water heaters Ok-that's actually what I thought you meant.  Sigh...that's even more difficult that then other! I doubt any of our databases will cover this, unless it's in an article.  While we have dbs on market share, annual reports, I don't know that anyone has to report water heater energy used, or even what type of water heater they have.  Is this for a paper you're doing?? And just curious-what dept? Yeah, that's kind of what I expected. This is for a research project in business communications. Thanks for your input! Wait...don't run off Yep, still here! I'm trying some things, but usually data comes from someone having to report to some organization, gov't agency, etc.  As I say...don't know who you'd have to report this to-no one!  Why don't you give me your email.  For reasons I stated, don't thing I'll find it, but in case I do, will want to share! Okay, thank you! I'm going to look at environmental and governmental agencies to see if I can find anything My email is mllin@andrew.cmu.edu Got it! Any particular type of retailers? Not really any in particular Good! LOL!!! and if I find just one-i.e. a case study-is that good enough? Absolutely! I'm about to head to my next class, so I have to go. Thank you so much for your help!  You're welcome! Will be in touch!

Do you keep a log of items that I've checked out? hi I can't remember the name of a book I borrowed last winter yes and no you can see what you have currently by going to my account.  Do you know where that is? Items that you have brought back already are automatically eliminated from your record privacy reasons ok thanks anyway! sure .. do you need the link to My Account? No, my question was about an item that I had checked out and returned -- not about an item I currenlty have checked out. ah, ok .. anything else then? That was my only question.  Thank you for your help

Hello? hi I am looking for the Information Networking Institute MS thesis archive The INI web page says that all theses are archived at the library Are they available online? Well, I don't think we have a special place for that-do you have a particular title?  Most of our thesis are offsite.  Many are available online via databases. If you go to our A-Z database page (I'll send link) and go to "D" you'll see the Dissertations and Abstracts @ Carnegie Mellon. It was the thesis completed by Gregor W. Kronenberger http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?a=d just a sec and I can check for you. Once research is complete, students present and defend their project work and conclusions to an audience of their peers and faculty. Work culminates in a written technical report or thesis that is published and archived in the library. Students may find reports from previous classes in the Engineering and Science Library in Wean Hall. From http://www.ini.cmu.edu/current_students/grad_project/ There seem to be just 3 MS theses in the CMU dissertation archive I checked both our catalog (which would list any offsite), and also the Diss & These @CMU database, and there isn't one by that name.  I should say that while we ask dept's and students to give us a copy of their dthesis, if they don't give us a copy, we won't have a copy.  Likewise, if they don't submit a copy to UMI,  then there won't be copy in the database Hmm Is this a very recent one? Do you also only retrieve 3 MS theses from CMU? Yes, December 2014 Well, that's not so recent.  I don't understand what you mean by 3 MS theses from CMU. http://search.proquest.com/pqdtlocal1006828/advanced?accountid=9902 University/institution: Exact("Carnegie Mellon University") Manuscript type: [X] Master's theses Ah-I see The query returns just 3 theses It seems that the departments do not automatically archive the theses with the library :( OK, well, that sort of answers my question Thank you for your help The department probably has a copy.  Most of the material in the Diss and Thesis db are PhD dissertations, not necessarily master's thesis.  The same with paper-most of what we have in the library are dissertations. Let me try a few things. ok Sorry, didn't find anything-was hoping he had a webpage or something.  The only thing I can suggest is contacting the department and seeing if they have a copy. Yes, will do, thank you You're welcome.  Sorry we could not provide what you needed. This is a difficult task. No worries :) bye

Hi there. Can you tell me if there is any way I can add books to the book bag so you could pick them out for me so I can pick them up? Hi No, Sorry, that is not a service we provide. OK, do you also offer research services? in particular in social theory on labour? Please define exactly what you mean by research services.  We have subject librarians who can help you with your research topics-suggesting databases, helping with search strategies, etc., that kind of thing. (What do I fill out in the research consultation form?) right, so do you suggest books tht are relevant? or only how to search? We will help you do searches to find relevant material.  Part of research is deciding what works for your topic. What department are you with? I teach in the HCII and is that what you need help with (I'm trying to decide which librarian would be most helpful). right, of course we are starting a research project on professional identity development in online labour markets Let me check something-just a minute please thank you! The librarian for that is Jillian Chisnell jillianc@andrew.cmu.edu

where can I read the whole report? Hi! Can you give me more information on the report you are trying to access? CompaniesandMarkets.com News: Global voice biometrics market players Nok Nok Labs and AGNITiO launch the first ever FIDO ready voice biometrics products for the above report, I only see the abstraction and can not see where can I download or read the whole article Okay, thanks for that information. Are you finding this result in a database from the library's website? from my school library's website, and it redirects me to proquest site from cmu school library's website Ahh I see. I think I have found it as well. Sometimes the "full text" results within some of the ProQuest results are a bit tricky. In this case this looks to be a post from a blog that has been provided through ProQuest. This is often the case with market research reports in ProQuest as well. They end up being advertisements for the reports or in this case a blog, but the actual report is not available. It is more of a press release announcing it in a way. Are you with the Tepper School by chance? yes Okay, are you interested in the biometrics market? yes, i am interested in voice biometrics market  Okay, I can lead you to some comparable resources that we have that may yield some helpful results. great, thank you so much I am the business librarian by the way. My name is Ryan Splenda :) my pleasure! nice to meet you. thank you for your help Nice to meet you as well :) Okay, so I have created a research guide on Market Research that can be accessed here: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/marketresearch On this page are all of the resources that we have that may be helpful. Since you are looking at biometrics, I would suggest the following databases for reports: BCC Research and Frost & Sullivan for sure. There is a possibility that something might show up within Gartner and IBISWorld, but it may be a bit leaner than the previosu two mentioned For example, I did a quick search in BCC Research and found a report called "Biometrics: Technologies and Global Markets" that may be of interest You can fully download the reports in most of these resources, except for Frost & Sullivan (unfortunately we only have read-only access to their content). BUT, if you find a report of interest and want the PDF, I have a way of getting those for you. yes, I find lots of article there. thank you so much so bcc % frost &amp; You are welcome! my name is henry. Thank you for your kindness.  Pleasure to meet you, Henry! And it's my pleasure. Also if all else fails, consider the trade publication route. Many times industry professionals will publish articles on niche industries, products and services, and company info in these publications for other industry professionals. The main resource to consider for this is: Business Source Complete (also located on that guide under the "News sources on markets, industries" section) understand Awesome! Is there anything else that I can help with today? no, thank you for your time and kindness. You are most welcome! Good luck with everything :) If you need to reach me again, my email is rsplenda@andrew.cmu.edu great! have a good day. byebye! Bye! :)

Hi. I need help in research Hi What can I help you with? I am currently in Business Communications [70-340] and my team and I need to perform research for our project. And we are trying to sell a product that will help farming in 4 countries: Uganda, Congo, Kenya and India OK-I'm going to transfer you to the business librarian-he's on chat right now-just a second. Ok thank you You're welcome! hi! This is Ryan! How are you? Hi Ryan. I'm fine thank you. How are you? I would like to receive some help in my research for Business Communications [70-340] I'm doing well, thanks :) Okay, how can I help My team and I are trying to pitch 2 agricultural products that will help farming in 4 countries: Uganda, Congo, Kenya and India The 2 products are a seeder that will help sowing seeds in farms, and a trailer that will help farmers transport crops However, in order to pitch these 2 products, we need to first understand farming practices in these 4 countries So for the seeder, we need to know how farmers currently plough and sow seeds And for the trailer, we wanted some research on road conditions in Kenya, Congo, Uganda and India, and also what are the primary means of transporting harvested crops. We could not find much information online, so we wanted to know where we can find information regarding this. Okay, thanks for explaining all of that information.  And the reason we need this information is that we need to pitch these 2 products to a start-up and so we need to show how these products will be feasible/improve farmers' lives Have you looked in any of the library's business databases yet? Yes. But we could not find information on farming practices Did you check in the two business literature databases by chance? They are Business Source Premier and ABI/INFORM Erm so i am not sure what databases I checked. But I might have missed them out. So let me try again I am doing a quick search within Business Source premier right now No worries! Let me get you the links to those databases Do you have access to the class Library Research Guide by chance? If not, here it is: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/70-340 Yes i do Great! You showed us the website in class That's right. Let's take a quick look in the Business Source Premier database search for these two terms (one in each box) farming practices AND uganda ok Did you get a list of 9 results? There may be some relevant information in some of these articles yes Okay, make sure to check the box that says Full Text on the left so that you can get the articles right away So, try and repeat this practice with the other 3 countries as well. Ok i will look at them. Thank you I think that your best bet is to search these literature databases for this type of information because it is your best shot at getting this type of information. There are other options for road conditions and infrastructure Hold on one second Ok. Thank you Yes I will repeat this for all 4 countries Okay great! For the infrastructure/road conditions question. You may want to check these same two resources using the methodological approach that we just covered So for example, "road conditions" AND India OR infrastructure AND Kenya Now, another database to consider for this is Business Monitor International. This has country-specific reports and articles It can be found on this research guide: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries Within that guide, look for Business Monitor International in the "Industry Overviews" box It's a little tricky to navigate so maybe we should go over quickly if you have time? Ok sorry I was looking at all the results No worries at all! I think I got the hang of it I just did some searches on Business Monitor INternational Awesome! So, it may be easier to use the "Browse by Location" tab because you can target a specific country that way Within BMI I mean Ok that is what I did. Thank you. Yea I will use these 2 databases to search for what we need And I will let you know how it goes Btw my name is Varun Prakasam and I thank you very much Ryan for helping Sounds good, Varun! Pleasure chatting with you Let me know how it goes. If we need to meet in person as well, I'd be more than happy to do so Actually, let me check one more thing for you if you have time I may have found a resource that will give you a quick snapshot of the road conditions for each country and it is a freely available resource It is called the CIA World Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ You can select different countries from the drop down lilst Oh wow that will be great Once a country profile is loaded, go to the transportation section and look for "Roadways". This will give you a quick snapshot of the total paved vs unpaved roadways  Again it's just a quick figure, but could be useful in an overview Okay I just saw it. That helps. We can do a ratio of paved to unpaved roads as an overview Thanks once again Right, that's what I was thinking as well. And in Uganda's case, this could be very eye-opening You are most welcome! Thanks for taking the time to reach out to us.  If you have any further questions, you can get in touch with me at rsplenda@andrew.cmu.edu Thank you for helping. Okay I will reach out to you in a few days if I have lingering questions. Sounds good, Varun Is there anything else that I can help with?

Can you tell me names of milk delivery companies in pittsburgh in early 1900? I can see what I can find out.. Is this research for a particular project? The story I'm writing about my grandfather who drove a horse-drawn milk wagon in Lawrenceville 1902-1920. ok..Have you already contacted archivists at University of Pittsburgh--Historic Pittsburgh? http://www.library.pitt.edu/ask-archivist I looked at digital images but saw nothing difinitive. Yes, I would definitely contact them via link that I sent you But let me check further one moment My aunt thought my grandfather worked for Otto but they didn't start up until 1928.  I want to correct my record. I'm just exploring a bit but would want to devote some time on your qx. The Pittsburgh City Directory from the time period that you are seeking might be of interest.  The Carnegie Library of PIttsburgh may be able to help you with directories searching also if you are willing to provide your email...I can explore further..Donna Beck, Engineering Librarian http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/s/schnabel/schnabel.htm Okay.  I'm 80 and live in Zelienople.  I did most of my family history research in Oakland when I lived in Pittsburgh.  I'll send you a note at your e-mail address. Thank you very much. my email is donnab@andrew.cmu.edu
