Can you tell me names of milk delivery companies in pittsburgh in early 1900? I can see what I can find out.. Is this research for a particular project? The story I'm writing about my grandfather who drove a horse-drawn milk wagon in Lawrenceville 1902-1920. ok..Have you already contacted archivists at University of Pittsburgh--Historic Pittsburgh? http://www.library.pitt.edu/ask-archivist I looked at digital images but saw nothing difinitive. Yes, I would definitely contact them via link that I sent you But let me check further one moment My aunt thought my grandfather worked for Otto but they didn't start up until 1928.  I want to correct my record. I'm just exploring a bit but would want to devote some time on your qx. The Pittsburgh City Directory from the time period that you are seeking might be of interest.  The Carnegie Library of PIttsburgh may be able to help you with directories searching also if you are willing to provide your email...I can explore further..Donna Beck, Engineering Librarian http://www.coachbuilt.com/bui/s/schnabel/schnabel.htm Okay.  I'm 80 and live in Zelienople.  I did most of my family history research in Oakland when I lived in Pittsburgh.  I'll send you a note at your e-mail address.

Hello! I am a staff member and I have a question regarding a publication. Hi I am not sure if this is the correct point of contact, but I was told the university has a subscription to the Chronicle of Higher Education that staff can access. Is this true? Yes!  It's in our list of Research Databases.  Go to the Libraries' homepage www.library.cmu.edu and you'll see a link under the search box, or under the "Search and Find" Menu.  In the Research Databases, click on "C" for Chronicle and you should see it listed. Great. Thank you so much!!! You're very welcome! :-) Follow up question! Do I need to log in to view articles or can I already since it is a CMU premium account? If you're on a CMU IP address, you should be able to get in seamlesslly and read articles.  If you're off campus, you should be prompted for your Andrew user ID and password, and then you should be able to read articles. Oh great! thank you! You're welcome!

I'm on the CMU-SECURE network, but when I try to access a ProQuest book, I'm being asked to sign in Hi What's the title of the book? Metasploit Ok-thanks-just a minute while I check some things out. Ok, thank you! I'm on a CMU IP address and I can access the text.  Did you use the link in our catalog?   hmm, yes http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781593272883?uicode=cmellon Is the link I was using And when you click on "start reading," or one of the sections in the books (on the left)...you get a login prompt? I just tried connecting to the VPN to make sure that I'm on the network, and when I click "Start reading," I still get this message: "ou are viewing the content on this page in Preview Mode.    I don't know that I can answer why this is not working.  What happens when you try the link without the VPN-I'll give you the record URL with the link.  http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1713316 Oh I just clicked the sign in as a library user link and it worked Thanks so much! OK-glad it worked.  Yes, with VPN mus use library resources, also must use links in catalog or from our website (for databases) rather than going to vendor directly.  I'm not sure what I did-but glad you're all set and able to read the book.  E-books can be tricky-vendors sometimes drop them out/change links without telling us, so a tad difficult to troubleshoot.  Anyway-happy reading!

Hi Hello! How do I get access to the eTexts? I find a book I need to use in a e-text form Can you provide a bit more information?   Do you mean an ebook? yes What specific book are you looking for? its named An Introduction to Transport Phenomena in materials engineering Okay--great.  Just a moment while I look for that. Here is the catalog record for the electronic version of the book. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1520119 You'll see a link that says "Multiple Users" under the holdings tab. Try clicking on that and let me know if that gives you access to the book. Okay  Gotcha... finally got it work.. Great--sometimes only so many people can use the item at the same time. Perhaps there were too many users the last time you tried. Is there anything else I can help with? nothing

Is the ebook version of Wrigley, Population and History actually available? Let me check http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/170457 Record says available You can find e-books and their availability in our catalog, just like you would a book-see the libraries' homepage for catalog  http://www.library.cmu.edu/ ooops-just lie you would a print book! Right, but there's no clickable URL next to the Electronic Resource notice.  Just the the green Avaible notice. !!!!! You're right-there's no URL in the record at all (I just checked the "behind the scenes" info-let me look some more. Ok.  Thank you. Hi .....are you still there? Yes-still checking-I got a message you left conversation....I'm talking to head of cataloging now OK....I closed the wrong tab! Sorry.  I am still interested. no prob-just hang in there-will get info soon Turns out that the indication that it was available on the web should not have been in the record-it is currently being removed.  We may have had intentions of scanning it at one time via our various scanning projects, but someone probably noticed it's a 1969 book, and thus still under copyright-can't scan w/out copyright holder's permission, and at the time we were only scanning books we had that didn't require permissions. So sorry, e-book is not available, but there is a copy offsite that you can request since the other copy is checked out.  It should be here within 24 hours OK. Will do.  Thanks and goodbye. Thanks for asking about this-it allows us to clean up record so no one else will see dud link.  Have a good day.

Hi,  Hello\ I requested a book last week. How can I check its status? What is the book title? comparative issues in the governance of research biobanks Where did you request it from? Off-site? Interlibrary Loan? Holds? I filled out the forms online. But I dunno how to chck it Do you know what form it was? I don't remember its name there was one from CMU You probably used one of these services. http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting You could try logging in to check the status. yes it was Illiad it says: request send Would I be contacted when the book is ready? You might want to contact the interlibrary loan office. http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/andrew-marshall You would be contacted when it has arrived. I see. I guess I'll wait. Thank you for your help. You are welcome.

Hello, I'm looking for access to nature magazine. Do you have digital access somewhere? hi .. good morning .. let me check .. what year are you interested in? 2015 Feb, Mar, and Apr ok .. it looks like we have it .. here's the info:  Nature (London)  (0028-0836)
      
from 01/04/1990 to 1 year ago in Biology Database, Health & Medical Collection, Nursing & Allied Health Database, ProQuest Central (purchase pre-March 2016), ProQuest Research Library, Psychology Database and Science Database
from 1997 to present in Nature Journals Online
from 01/06/2000 to 1 year ago in Academic OneFile and General OneFile you can access the links from e-Journals - http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals search by title "nature" Great! Thank you! you're welcome Have a nice day! you too

Hello Hi, how can I help you? I am Karandeep Bajaj and will be joining CMU this fall Great to hear! I wanted to ask about the book borrowing process I'm a MSE student So for example I want to borrow "Concurrency: State Models and Java Programs" by Magee and Kramer  So can you tell me the process ? Sure, are you on the Pittsburgh campus or at the Silicon Valley Campus? Pittsburgh Okay, are you able to find the record for the book in our catalog? Yes Great, the record indicates that this book is in our Engineering & Science Library.  That's the Sorrell's Engineering & Science Library on the fourth floor of Wean Hall. Our printed books are all in one area within the library... ok You'll use the call number "QA76.642 .M34 2006" to find the book on the shelf. Then, you can take the book to the front service desk and they'll check it out to you.  If you're not in the system yet, they can put you in the system. okay Here is some general information about borrowing and renewing that I think will help:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/borrow/who okay thanks Just few more questions Sure! How many books at a time ? 100 ? As a graduate student, yes ... it's 100 at a time. Most people borrow far fewer items, but for doctoral students ... well, we don't want anything to slow them down. okay makes sense For how long can i keep a book? It's important to note that a borrowed book is subject to a recall if the person had had it for one week and someone else needs to use it. 90 days ? That's correct.  You get one online renewal. For a total of 180 days.  Then we make sure you can actually still locate it by asking you to bring it back. If nobody else has a hold on it, the process can start again for 180 days. Suppose I have loaned a book and after a week somebody else also requests a book. So in that case i need to return it ASAP or after 90 days ? Current course textbooks are a problem though.  We try to keep a copy or two to circulate within the library, but that's all.  We really try to collect in digital format now - that goes for all science & engineering books. You'd need to return it as soon as practical. You could place a hold on it as well - getting it back in about a week and a half. If a book is too popular, we will explore getting a second print copy or, more preferably, a digital version. Your best person to reach out to with a problem like that will be your liaison librarian. See:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/expert How does a student get to read a digital version of a book ? Help me out ... MSE ... would that be part of the ECE Department, SCS ... or Heinz College these days? MSE is a part of SCS Okay ... your liaison librarian is Jillian Chisnell Miller. To get a digital version of a book ... Many will be found in our catalog via our library's main web site. However, the world of e-books is kind of messy right now ... So, you'll also want to use our"Articles & More" search to e-books that are available to you ... Plus, some might be identified in the research database known as JSTOR. If you're uncertain, feel free to ask us via whatever means is most convenient.  See:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/help/ask ok sure thanks Have a great day Glad to help.  U 2!

Thx We don't subscribe electronically - now I'll check the print We apparently only have up to vol. 62 - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/437792 but you can request any article you want from interlibrary loan -http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting Alright, thank you!

Hi, are the Foundations and Trends journals from Now Publishers available through the library? hi let me check we have several journals with the words "foundations and trends" available via our eJournals Here's a list:     Foundations and trends in accounting  (1554-0642)
      
from 08/01/2006 to 12/31/2006 in Academic OneFile you can find it by going to http://library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals typing "foundations and trends" and selecting the desired title However, they are not available through the present .. most are back issues .. were you looking for recent issues? Yes Ah, then you probably have to borrow the article you need via ILLiad.  Or ask the librarian from your department if we can purchase current access .. though that wouldn't be immediate.  What school/college/department are you in? I'm a grad student in the Robotics Institute It's okay, I'll find relevant papers that I can access Ok, I would also contact your liaison librarian .. do you know who they are? I do not. Who should I contact? Jill Chisnell her email is jillianc@andrew.cmu.edu Alright, thanks a lot! You are most welcome .. anything else? No, that's all ok .. have a great day

Hello,  Hi How may I help you? I'm a CIT prof and we're launching a CMU research project next week. It'll have it's own website I'm looking for some advice on how to recommend folks "cite" the website.  I guess it won't be a DOI, as its not a report. Although we'll have a corresponding report in the CMU repository. But our website (emissionsindex.org), which goes live on Tuesday, will have info on it that folks will cite. Does it need a DOI? There are a number of different styles that a website could be cited in For example (APA, Chicago, MLA, etc.) I asked Lynn Berard but she's out of town. Are you requiring a specific style? It won't necessarily need a DOI because it's not technically a journal article Thanks-  Let me see if I can get an example citation for a website in APA for you It's alright, I can go get that. Thanks, have a great day

good morning! i'm looking for a book that does not seem to be in the CMU system, but i am notoriously bad at finding things. can you help? title is Connections: Writing, Reading, and Critical Thinking hi sure ..  let me check grazie prego :) ok .. so we only have it in the Qatar campus library .. let me check to see if PITT has it for now, or a local library .. meanwhile, I'll make a note to order a copy for our campus (lucky you, I am the English liaison) :) sweet!! i'm writing a proposal for a textbook, based on my class, and i'm sizing up the competition :) one more that seems only to be in ebook format is Engaging ideas the professor's guide to integrating writing, critical thinking, and active learning in the classroom, by John Bean.  then of course you will need to order a copy of mine when it's done!! ok .. hold on .. one at a time .. do you have an author for the first? in case there are other books with a similar title hang on, yes. megan c. rainey, and it looks like the isbn might be 0205607330 i think the connections book comes with a teacher's guide, which i'd love to see as well.  ok .. that's helpful .. hold on here's the amazon link https://www.amazon.com/Connections-Writing-Reading-Critical-Thinking/dp/0205607330 ok .. the connection title doesn't seem to be in a local library .. so you'll need to borrow it using ILLiad .. have you used that before? i have. i also have been banned at the moment. :)  i have evilly not returned some books i need for my research, so i have to scan some books and return them, which i'm doing today.  are there scanners in the library(ies)? Ok, when you do, we'll lift the ban .. there are scanners in the library yes in all of them?  yes.  May I also have your contact email so I can let you know when we get a copy in print?  It may take a couple of weeks, but I'll rush it. dmcar@andrew Ok, and you are .. :) i promised my agent i'd get her the proposal by the 20th, so i'll work around it, but whatever you can do would be great.  the john bean book looks just as promising, if you want to take a look at that. it's in ebook format, but a real book would be nice. it's published by wiley. he's an english prof at university of seattle oh, sorry denise caruso heh Ok, Denise .. ordered a copy of connections and will let you know as soon as it comes in.  Meanwhile, you can get a copy of it through ILLiad. thank you! Now to the other title .. hold .. need to scroll up for the title  at which library are you located, btw?  Hunt may i ask your name?  Ethan .. I am the liaison for English, Philosophy, and Modern Languages what department are you in? engineering and public policy, nominally that's where the class is stationed. Good news .. we have the second book as an e-book and you can access it online i'm also working with philosophy. even with my disgraced account? which i swear i will rectify today no I mean what department affiliation, not the class :) engineering and public policy.  EPP in CIT ok .. let me get you the link to the ebook .. you can access from on campus, or log in with Andrew ID if you're on a laptop or off campus thank you! i'll be in soon to scan and redeem myself. here's the link to the ebook - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1616601 thank you, ethan.  you'll see a line in bold "online access" .. multiple user .. click on that to view the book my pleasure .. this subject happens to be my main research interest as well .. so happy to know about the books okey doke. i wish it were a physical copy but maybe i can use a library computer to pull it up and work with my laptop next to it. god forbid i actually take notes. :)  let me check PITT for a physical copy .. hold if that is the case, i will keep you posted on others that i find. there were surprisingly few in the searches that i made. there's a trend towards ebooks .. I like them .. easier to "carry" lol true dat. In that case .. we should meet .. perhaps I can guide your search .. it may be a matter of using the right terms i would love that. let me get squared away with the ILLiad thing at Sorrels, and I will come by.  thanks again!  see you soon ... stepping away now hold on PItt has a print copy PE1404 .B35 2011 several in fact .. 2 are checked out and one in storage  use ILLiad to get the print .. mention in the notes field that you need the print not electronic .. so they don't decline your request Anything else I can help with?

Good morning. hi I have a question for statista. Can we use statista as a premium account? My friend said that, but I cannot find the instruction on the library web site. Statista is listed on our A-Z list of Databases. On the Libraries homepage, www.library.cmu.edu under Search and Find, you'll see the link to research databases once in the list just go "S" and you'll see Statista listed. Yes, I found that, but I just use as a basic account. I would like to see the premium data. Let me see Where are you seeing "basic" versus "premium" For example, on this page, the icon with "+" is premium data.  https://www.statista.com/search/?statistics=1&amp;forecasts=1&amp;dmo=1&amp;studies=1&amp;industryReports=1&amp;topics=1&amp;infos=1&amp;interval=0&amp;category=0&amp;subCategory=0&amp;region=0&amp;archive=1&amp;q=solar+forecast&amp;sortMethod=idrelevance&amp;accuracy=and&amp;isRegionPref=1&amp;subCategory=0 We have a group account which allows for access to all statistics.  How do I know the group account? I accessed from campus by using library vpn. If you use the link in the database list, you will get access to our group account, which gives access to all statistics, plus downloading by excel, etc.  Is there some statistic/feature that you need that you cannot get into? I got it. Thank you for your time.

Hi hi I am trying to search for the book "The passions of the mind; a novel of Sigmund Freud" as per records it is supposed to be in PZ3 .S87872 PAV STACKS second floor but I didn't find it there also other books by the same author "Irving Stone" are missing Could you direct me to the location of the book? Or maybe could the book be kept on-hold at the front desk? If you are not finding books where they are supposed to be and they are marked as available in the catalog, you can go to the Circulation Desk and ask that a tracer be put on the book.  Library staff will look for them for a number of weeks, notify you if we have it or mark it missing if it can not be found.  If you are uncertain that you were looking in the correct area, Circulation Staff may also be able to go to the stacks (this may depend on staffing) and make sure that you were looking in the right area.   Sure, thank you As for passions of the mind, we have 2 copies, on that is supposed to be on the second floor and the other is offsite.  You can request that the offsite one be brought to campus.  This usually takes a day or two. Oh okay, will do that Thank you You are welcome.   For other books that are not available you can use the E-Z Borrow system. Let me know if you'd like more info on that Sure, will contact if required. Thank you! You're welcome!

Hi, I was wondering if I could get help on some research I'm doing! Hi! How may I help? So I'm doing my thesis on fixed exchange rate regimes, and part of my thesis specifically centers on EDA of those countries before and after either fixing the values of their currency or dollarizing. I was able to find the list of countries that currently are in those regimes via the IMF's report, but I have been looking everywhere and am struggling to find the years that these countries change over from floating exchange rates to fixed exchange rates I was wondering if there is a certain place I should be looking? Okay, sounds like some interesting research that you are working on Are you, by chance, a  Tepper student? Yes, I am! Wonderful! My name is Ryan and I am the liaison librarian to the Tepper School. Pleasure to meet you :) Awesome!! Nice to meet you too :) My name is Vaasavi. :) So, you were able to find the list of countries that changed to fixed exchange rates in an IMF report? And you need to figure out when they changed over? Yeah, I was. If you'd like, I can either link you the report itself, or send you over the list of countries That would be great! I was going to ask about the IMF report and if I can see it. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/nft/2014/areaers/ar2014.pdf I'm thinking that there may not be a one-stop solution to finding out this information. Page four is what I'm using; specifically looking at exchange rate anchors but stopping at the stabilized arrangement; crawling peg is not what I want Okay. Have you found that the fixed exchange rate is set up or determined by a larger body or organization? Or is this done more on an individual government basis? Forgive me, this isn't exactly my area of expertise :) It depends. So the bolded acronyms are names of currency unions--those would be larger bodies that determine the fixed rates. Otherwise, it happens on an individual government basis And no worries, it's not even my thesis advisor's expertise haha Okay, lol. Well I would probably have to do some additional digging into this myself. I would imagine that some of the places to consider this type of information are the IMF (which you have identified). I'm wondering if there would be some information from the World Bank's perspective as well Would it be possible for us to meet sometime to further go over this? I would really appreciate that! When would be best for you? And I'll look into the World Bank some more; the IMF has a dataset (I think) but it's stuck behind a paywall Okay, that's good to know. Just an FYI, we have the International Financial Statistics of the IMF listed on our research databases list through the library. I can't remember if we have backdoor access to some of the data sets that you are interested in, but it may be worth taking a look at that as well. Here is our listing: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?q=international%20financial%20statistics Okay, I was looking for that but I don't think I was able to find it. Thanks for the link! Were you accessing the IMF outside of the library? you are welcome! Yeah, I was; I was in NOLA for spring break so I was trying to get some work done in the mornings before my friends woke up lol In terms of meeting up. I have consultation hours over at Tepper tomorrow from 2-4PM if you'd like to stop during that time? Completely understand, haha Yeah, I can do that. I'm free between 2 and 3:30. Where should I meet you? Great! I have a little table that I set up at near Simon Auditorium Kind of close to where that little area is for people to sit outside  Okay, cool. I have it in my gcal! Good deal. Pleasure talking with you, and looking forward to seeing you tomorrow! Thank you! See you tomorrow! :) You are welcome

Access via MIT Press (2000-present)  would i have to log in to access? If you're offcampus or on wireless, you should get a login prompt.

Hi. Which database do you recommend to look for industry reports? I'm specifically looking at the truckload industry. hi The business librarian has a research guide that outlines the best resources for industrial research http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries Great! Thank you! You're welcome!

I'm having trouble logging in with my Andrew ID. I seem to be logged in, but it requests my CMU ID and PIN number, and tells me "We cannot log you in at this time. Please try again later." What is it you are trying to log into? The library.cmu.edu webpage. I am trying to access IEEE Xplore Ok, so you're off campus, and using the proxy to get into the database? Yes Let me see if I can help.  Just a minute please Would you please try any other database and see if you get the same message? Actually, it seems that I only get the message when I go to "MyAccount" at the top right corner of the page. I seem to be able to access IEEE Xplore despite the error message when logging in OK, took a while, but I could get in on campus.  Wait...stop Logging in at the top corner is ONLY for your library account-what you have checked out, renewing books, etc. NOT for accessing the databases. To log into the databases off campus, just click on the database name after clicking on research databases, and then login with your andrew user ID and psswd. Ah, ok! I hope that helps to clarify- I know it can be confusing-too many logins!! ;-) Yes, that helps! I haven't checked out any books yet so maybe thats just not setup yet Thanks so much! Glad it works!! If you continue to have problems with logging into library account (upper right hand corner), then check with any Circulation desk-they'll be happy to help. Even there, though, you should just need your andrew user ID and psswd! Sorry, must run to a meeting and none of my colleagues are on chat.  If you have additional questions, you can send to huntref@andrew.cmu and we'll be happy to answer them.  I'll be back on chat after my meeting! Have a great day! :-)

HI. I am currently researching Maya murals, significant colors, and pigments used by the Maya.  I am trying to write a paper in which I connect the art of the Maya and their significant colors to either the Spanish colonial period or modern day art in Mexico. I found information for all the Maya stuff but am finding it very hard to have something to compare it to is this dealing with the arts the liaison librarian from the arts would be best to help you. You can send her an e-mail. Her name is Mo Dawley  md2z@andrew.cmu.edu or call her at 412-268-6625

Hi, there's book that's checked out that I'd like to place a hold on. How do I do that? Hi there unfortunately our system is down, so it's not allowing holds.   the good news is that some of the books that it says are checked out are not - so if you're near the library you can check the shelves We're sorry for the inconvenience!  They are working on it - hope it will be back up soon. Cool, can I just tell you the book(s), are you able to find out? And no problem! OK - what's the book? Book 1: After Virtue, by MacIntyre is this a book required for a class? Nope! good - more likely it will be there!  this will take a while because I need to use another system to look it up, and then look for it on another floor.  what is your email? Ok -- thanks! If you don't have time to go physically look for it, you can just email me the call number (I can't see it atm). My email is will.nalls@googlemail.com. Could you also look for book 2: Knowledge in Action, by Reiter? not gmail? is this the first book:  https://www.worldcat.org/title/after-virtue-a-study-in-moral-theory/oclc/10751724&referer=brief_results lol gmail works too. Yes, that's it. The Reiter book is an e-book - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1016684
  and the link is right there (where it says "online access") so you could get it that way (We are a subscriber) Yes, I've found an e-copy of the Reiter book, but I also wanted to check for the physical copy, since it may actually be available. That's not urgent, though, I can get that after the system is back up. Ok, I need to run, but if you could send me the call number for the MacIntyre book, I'll check if it's there -- thanks! Well if we have the Reiter book in print, it would be at Sorrells and the call number should be Q387 .R48 2001
  Oh great, thanks. OK will do

Does the library have copies of IEEE standards, specifically 29148? Hi Yes, the library should have all IEEE standards within our IEEE Xplore database.  Do you know where our research databases are listed off of the library's main web page? I'll look for 29148 ... 29148-2011  -  Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering   <-- Yes, I found it there. okay excellent Are you able to find IEEE Xplore okay? at the moment I'm having some issues Let me know if I can help.  I can at least send the standard to your andrew email address. rhoover@alumni.cmu.edu I think Do you by any chance have an andrew email address?  I'm forbidden by licensing restrictions to send the standard to an alumni address.  If you happen to be near campus, you're welcome to come and get a day pass. I understand. I'll try to come in sometime Thank you for your help. Glad to try.

Hello! I am conducting a literature review for a research project and am having trouble accessing a few papers. I remember being told by a library representative in a research methods course that I should ask a librarian if I ever can't access a paper. Are you able to help me?  what paper do you need help with? There are a few:  The treatment of autism: A human protest.

Hi hello how may i help you? I am looking for health insurance laws and regulations in the United Kingdom.  HeinOnline has not yielded anything. are you looking for recent laws or historical? Recent Including EU That is probably why .. I believe HeinOnline covers early law .. Did you look in Lexis-Nexis Academic? Ah, I will check. It was my understanding LexisNexis has an academic product which we have, and a legal specific product we don't have access to Here's the link http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/? you do have access to legal research .. it is complicated to search so you may want to think about coming in to see a librarian.  With what department are you affiliated? I am with the Tepper School, but out of town right now When do you get back? Our new business librarian Ryan starts Friday, July 1st :) Ah, how convenient! Roye Werner is still there? We don't have an email for him yet, but we will .. so you can just email me (Ethan) at ethanp@cmu.edu and I can work with Ryan on this .. Roye retired Also, I am on vacation but will be back Tuesday .. so hopefully I can meet with you and Ryan and help with your concquest :) Just a tip for now ... when you go to search Lexis-Nexis, use Browse to get to subject folders then click on law and narrow by "international" (for geography) and Health Care for subject  Ethan, thanks. I will be in touch with any further questions. great .. if you email me with more detail on the type of information you need, I can start looking too (and I will be able to share that with Ryan) Ok will do great .. have a safe trip back

Hi, I've this book that I wanted to reserve. I wanted to know if I can do it online? Hi Happy to help; I'm rather new here, please give me a moment to get an answer sure thank you Okay, is the book already checked out, or is it available? It's available  https://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/555273 I don't see any reserve button so I'm not sure Yep, okay, you can only place a hold on the book if it is already checked out; otherwise you will have to come into the Library in person to get the book.  If you like, I can go check now to make sure it is in the stacks I actually am in the library and I have the book with me right now Ah, okay, then you can check it out at the circulation desk near the front Ah ok can't do it online. Cool thanks Yes, sorry no - you have to check it out in person at the desk

Hi there.  Hi! How may I help? I am Alex from BME department. I was wondering if there is a way to get access to ANSI documents I am interested in the ANSI Z136.3 Laser Safety Standards. Hold on one second while I look up information on standards available through us Sure Okay, I have found a research guide that our science and engineering librarians have put together on locating and finding standards. It is available here: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/c.php?g=284451&p=1895467 Let me see if we can pinpoint this specific one using the databases that we subscribe to. okay. That sounds promising.  Yes. Forgive me as this is not my specialty area :) If we can't find it, it may be worth reaching out to the liaison librarian to BME Is this a fairly new standard? No its been around for a couple of decades... Oh okay.  the latest version is from 2011 I believe It is the ANSI Z136 Laser Safety and I only need the chapter Z136.3 about Laser in healthcare.  I know where to get it for a couple hundred dollars.... http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI+Z136.3-2011 Okay, yeah I can see that it is available for that as well.  I'm having issues seeing if we've already purchased this standard.  Me too :D  I think your best bet is to reach out to the BME Librarian to make sure. I can get you that person's info ok, sounds good Haha, yes! Okay our BME Librarian is Donna Beck and her contact info is here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/donna-beck Sorry about that, I'm just not the subject expert for standards haha It's fine. Thanks for your help.  You are welcome! Thanks for contacting us and have a great day :) You as well.

Hello Sue, this is Ema Grama. Hi Ema! I was wondering if you could direct me to the capstone research web page I am trying to find it on the site but I cannot thanks so much Certainly- it's http://guides.library.cmu.edu/globalstudies That's because you missed class the day we went over it-ha ha!! indeed:) thanks so much Sue! best wishes Just hope you are feeling better-take care! :-)

nobody answers the reference desk phone number. anybody home? What number are you calling? How can I help you? moving on. does the CMU library system subscribe to the Wall Street Journal online still? If so, what's the url Yes, it does. Do you want current issues? online means daily. this is for my students. I get it in paper and online via my personal subscription. you do not seem to have a listing for the daily online publication in your wonderful catalog.  http://www.wsj.com/ is the general portal; what are the CMU credentials? If you go to the Research Databases list, you will find a link to the full-text Wall Street Journal which is available through ProQuest. http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?a=w Unfortunately, it's not as nice as the real WSJ interface. If you enter Wall Street Journal into your Search and Find, what you describe does NOT come up. Obscurantism is hardly patron friendly... bye I will send your comments along. That's pointless of course. Bye

Hi. I'm looking for a recent book. Wanted to know if we have any online version. ok Handbook of Media Economics, vol 1A Simon Anderson, Dec 2015 or so If we do, it would be in the catalog just like the paper book, but I will check for you. and also Handbook of Media Economics, vol 1B We don't have any version/edition of Handbook of Media Economics Is there any chance to find it on another affiliated library? I checked Pitt as well, they don'thave it either.  You can either use interlibrary loan or EZ Borrow to get a copy. Let me know if you need a link to the page for ILL and/or EZ Borrow ? Sorry, I don't get this interlibrary loan-you fill out a form and we find a copy of the book for you EZ Borrow-you search a joint catalog (after loggin in with your 9 digit CMU ID #) and find an available copy, place a request, and the book comes in in 3-5 days This is how you can get items CMU doesn't have and when no local library has them Can you give me links to that? http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting ok I submitted for ILL When can I get an answer if you guys found the book? Excellent-they will notifiy you when the book is available for you to pick up. It usually takes about 5-7 days Depends where we have to go to get it (mailing) as well as the amount of requests at each library.  Your request goes on the bottom of our pile, then on the bottom of lending library.  You can see progress/process in your ILLiad account. OK Just want to know if the book is available somewhere... if it's not, I'll have to see how to get it How does CMU decides which books to buy? Usually a book is available "somewhere."  If you use the Worldcat database (on our homepage, under search and find, research databases) Each department/school on campus has a librarian who is responsible for buying books, answering in depth research questions, teaching classes on important resources in that field, etc.  if you tell me what dept./school you are in, I'll send you the name of your librarian and you can suggest a title to that person. I'm in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy Well you are in luck-I am your librarian, Sue Collins.  Epp acutally has 2, one for the engineering part (Lynn Berard), and I do the policy, etc. part. This 2 vols set is $259 dollars-do you want paper or e-version?

Hi hello how may i help? I'm a graduate student joining this Fall welcome :) Thank You how do I get a patron id? that is your Carnegie Mellon ID .. I tried logging in with that it didn't work logging in to what? I'm looking for this book http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/718672 could you please let me know if there any copies available for getting it issues if you're off campus .. you just use your Andrew ID (email) and password I tried logging in to E-Z borrow all copies at the engineering library are checked out, but it is available online  okay thanks for the info..should I give my id or id@andrew.cmu.edu to login to E-Z borrow? ohh I got it now it is asking me to use the 9 digit number on my id card Ok, if you're using EZ borrow .. you just put in your ID (nothing from @ on) you can use your 9 digit number too, that's the second set of numbers on your ID it didn't accept my andrew id when I used my 9 digit id I was able to login ok .. good  Thanks for everything..this chat was very helpful

Hi, Hi How can I help you today? How I can retrieve by Orchid ID and Research ID, I am not sure if I ever completed the information. Thanks In what way are you trying to retrieve info using those id's?  Are you in a particular database or did you want to check out a particular person's ORCID id? I am requested to enter those IDs in my annual report for the Chemistry Department. Also, I know some people include them in their CVs. I see.  Have you established either of them for yourself yet? That I do not remember. I believe I did some work but I believe never finished. I'll try to look you up, can you pass your name my way.  Here is my ORCID:  http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6278-3424 Matthew,  My name is Gloria L. Silva. I believe I met you before in some meeting/committee on campus.. Hi Gloria!  Let me see what I can find.  I'll be back with you as soon as I can. I looked at your picture and no, its not you the person I met before. Thanks for your help. Hi Gloria.  I was able to find an ORCID for a Gloria Silva, but nothing is public.  So all that I can see is:  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0763-8096 Perhaps you could try to login to your ORCID account?  If not, they will have a way to look up your user id an password. I assume I created a password that I do not remember it. I have tried looking for your Researcher ID, but I'm coming up empty on that.  Here is a page where you can request a Researcher ID:  http://www.researcherid.com/Home.action I got the password to my ORCID account and I can see that I have a lot to complete in my site. I think I did not make it public because I was doubtful on how the information would be used. If I make it fully public, who can access? (general public, mostly researchers, etc.) Anyone could see it, but typically only other researchers/funders would be interested.  When you look at your home page, your Researcher ID is usually listed if you have linked it to your ORCID.  See under "other id's."  If you haven't set it up yet, it's fairly quick to do so. Thanks Matthew. I will take care of this soon. Happy Holidays! Thank you!  In the long run, the ID's will help you out.  Let me know if you ever want to talk about them. Happy Holidays!

Hello!  How can I help you? I'm considering starting my own research project for next year (as a senior studying Business) and I'm wondering if you can push me in the right direction in terms of where to start? I need to find a topic, and I'm not sure which databases would be the most useful. Specifically, I'm interested in looking into the economic/financial impacts of the Ukraine/Russia crisis. Please start with the subject guide http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper  That's perfect, thank you! You are welcome.

Hi How are you? Hi How can I help you today? I am looking for a report "Big Data and Telecom Analytics Market: Business Case, Market Analysis & Forecasts 2014 - 2019"  Okay ... we have access to some market materials.  Let's hope this is one of them.  May I ask where you came across this? one moment please when i google the title, it shows a lot of links which directly linked to the purchasing pages if you have some links available, I can find it. Which sources do 'you have? Yes, market research firms are kind of famous for that.  Then they charge huge amounts of money.  I have at least come across a news item at:  http://search.proquest.com/docview/1440311464?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:summon alright, and am i eligible to access the link above? it says i have to log in It might prompt you for your andrew id and password.  If you search from the library's home page using an "Everything" search, it will show up in your "Articles & More" results. Unfortunately, it's a very expensive report that we don't own, but there may be very similar literature out there - I could give you some ideas on where to look. I would strongly recommend looking at our Business & Economics Librarian's "Industries" guide at:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries I just got some interesting results in the Frost & Sullivan database that she mentions on her guide by simply searching for "big data" (with the quotes). Frost & Sullivan will have full text of similar reports. Wow thank you very much I will look them up!!! Roye is amazing and her guides are rather helpful. Thank you very much! i just clicked the link and found a lot of market reports I sincerely appreciate your help regarding my request I'm hoping that you find some great stuff to review. yes and this will be definitely helpful for my research! thank you very much for your time  You're welcome!  Glad to help. Have a wonderful day!! U 2!  :-)

hello dear librarian. I am searching, so far in vain, for an article in a book. The book is Interdisciplinary Research Management, ISBN-13: 9780195062526 Hello. I can take a look. thank you.  Here is all the information that Oxford Scholarship Online provides for the article:   International Research Management
Philip H. Birnbaum, Frederick A. Rossini, and Donald R. Baldwin Yes. We have it at Hunt Library.  http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/461073 I am stymied.  I don't know why my search didn't pull it up.  Is it possible to get the fulltext of the article itself?  Did you search the title International Research Management? (Not Interdisciplinary Research Management_ OH.  What article do you need? <imaginary gun to head> Preconditions for Interdisciplinary Research
Julie Thompson Klein
Alan L. Porter
DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195062526.003.0002 Doesn't look like we have this in an electronic format. So when the info for the book says this:  Published to Oxford Scholarship Online: October 2011 Does that just mean it's the abstract?  Or can I get it through Illiad?  It's possible that it is available through Oxford Scholarship Online. But we do not subscribe to that resource. You can try Illiad. However, it's possible they will not fulfill the request because we own a copy of the book.  got it. OK! thank you so much.  You are welcome. Can I help with anything else?

Why can't I open full articles. It just gives me this abstract and full text of that article's abstract. because there's no fulltext? how are you accessing it? through a database? through a website? I search the article through the search engine in the website. It gives me these links. I open one of them. And it gives me these links to open the article I open that article and it just gives me the abstract  Where is the link to the full article  can you give me the title? so I can check? Public Opinion on US Airlines on Social Media which link are you clicking .. the one that says Article?  Yea This is a short article 222 words did you click on the last one (from ProQuest?) Yea well it should lead you to the article  Full Text Yea so its like the abstract right? no .. that's the article .. a short article Its a short article about a bigger article   Find out in Amplicate's new report 'Public Opinion on US Airlines on Social Media' that tells you what consumers have been saying about airlines on social media in the last 12 months, when and where they're posting their opinions and why What does this mean? Where is this report? you have to buy those talk to the business librarian?  which department do you do? Information Systems Okay. Thanks. But I think I'll survive without the article.

hello -- hi how may i help i'm trying to get industry analysis information on professional service organization (non profits) in the human resources sector I attempted this search using pro quest, but can't get any positive results. am i too specific (industry and sector)? have you looked at the industries guide?  There are other databases that would be better than proQuest - http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries  for example, you can search IBIS by NAISC (if you have that), or just type "human resources" and you'll get reports for the US and other countries. ProQuest might be ok for specific country info, but for industry analysis, you might want to check other databases. great. :)  i'll take a look here. hopefully this is the break i was looking for. thank you. good .. let us know if you have other questions anything else I can help with at this time? is there a recommended source that focuses on non profits, or professional service organizations. basically certification organization (i.e. the society for HR assoc. for the HR industry) Hoovers covers some .. but start with the business research guide - http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper  look at the companies tab ok. thank you. let me see if there's a guide to non-profit info ... actually, i just view the ibis and i have reviewed that info. however, it appears that my topic of interest is not represented. i am trying to obtain the market share of competing HR credentialing organizations (there are two SHRM and HRCI); and overarching financial information on HR professional associations that are located in major cities. Basically independent affiliates of SHRM. ah .. then you should look at the market tab .. not industry .. let me get you that http://guides.library.cmu.edu/marketresearch do you have specific companies in mind or just an over view? the society for human resource management ok .. try Statista will do...thank you! just a tip, I would start with looking for companies first .. find their industry codes then search industry databases ..  you mentioned 2 for example SHRM and HRCI let me see if I can find info that way first ok .. so Hoovers turns several hits for SHRM and you need to look at these to figure out the specific industry codes okay, i will try hoovers. it appears bc it is a non profit i'm not getting a lot of activity.  see for example http://subscriber.hoovers.com/H/company360/overview.html?companyId=77771640  thanks again. your help is most appreciated.  there's a link to an industry overview  here are your relevant codes from that report ... NAICS Codes you can use these for a more in-depth analysis HRCI is also listed in hoovers this is def. the informative source i have come across. i will start here...thanks again! you're welcome .. and here are the codes for HRCI .... NAICS Codes happy researching :) anything else? Just remember the strategy I mentioned: identify a company, look for info on it, get the industry codes from the report, then look in the industry guide for overall reports .. got it? :) yup. thanks :) ok .. if nothing more, have a great day indeed.  you too.

I'm having trouble finding it on the CMU Library website hi you can check eJournals for online .. let me get you that link .. I'll check for print http://library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals we also have it in print (in storage but you can recall it).

Yes, but we don't seem to have anything more recent than February, unless I'm missing something let me check Thank you! are you sure april 2016, not 2015?  We're still in March... This is the link to the article, but I can't read it because of the paywall: https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/ Like National Geographic, they put out the next month's issue during the current month hmmm..it looks like we stopped with 2015 .. if you provide me your email, I can follow up once I get to the bottom of this. Thank you very much. My email is aprichar@andrew.cmu.edu what is your name? Mandi Prichard I'm a Masters student at Heinz The april issue is in print on the 3rd floor Ah! Thank you! So we don't have an electronic subscription? no .. just the print .. and the library catalog shows that .. it just cuts off the 6 in 2016 .. so it looks confusing  gotcha. Thank you so much for your time! no problem .. anything else? That's all! great .. have a nice day

Hi. Do we have access to Scientific American articles that aren't otherwise free to read online? hi do you mean for CMU students, faculty, and staff? Students in particular, yes. You can check two places: our e-journals - http://library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals that way you see for what years and from what databases they are available  we also have them in print and on microfilm - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/207543 Found it in the eJournals. Thank you so much! you're welcome anything else? That was it. Thanks! have a great day then :)

Hi, I am a Teaching Assistant in Kigali, Rwanda. Hi My name is Linda Deen. How do I get a reader to read etext books from the library? Options include MARC and Refworks From what I know of our e-books, you don't need any special reader.   Then please explain when I download an etext file, it is in a specific format that I don't recognize but obviously it requires some kind of ereader. Can you give me the title of the work you're trying to read so I can try it?  With ebooks I've tried, I follow the link from the catalog and the text appears on my browser. Maybe it is not an ebook.  The title specifically refers to it as etext. Can you please give me the title? This way I can experience what you're talking about. Okay, I'll have to go get it.  If you have to go, then I'll contact the chat later with the specific titles.  Thanks. That would be the most helpful thing to do.   then we can see specifically what the issues are. Are these books you found in our catalog? 1606072 is a record number for one of the etext books Can you please give me the title? Perspectives and Policy on ICT... author is Berleur, Jacques  2005 Sorry, I can't copy and past into Chat. When I click on download for this title, a PDF opens and thecontents of the book appears, looking just like the book would. Another one...ICT Innovations 2014: World of Data They are in the Electronic Resources Library. Okay, but maybe you already have the ereader. AGain, when I click on the link provided in our catalog, I get the PDF.  Do you have Adobe on your PC? System asks me to select which format I want to use. Yes, I have Adobe.  Okay, I'll go back and try it all again. And sorry, don't know what you mean by Electronic Resources Library.  I get to these online books via our library catalog (assume you do too since you gave me the number for one). Yes, I logged in using my Andrew ID.  Thanks, I'll go back and try it all again.  Bye. Even Springer's homepage just says books are provided in PDF.  Usually I beleive people use Adobe to rad/creat, etc. PDFs.  So you may want to make sure it's on your device and up to date. If you have additional questions regarding this-you may want to contact the science librarians directly-they may have more experience with this since they deal more with Springer. You can email them at sciref@andrew.cmu.edu.  You'll then be able to send a copy and paste of what you see when you try to access the book. I think you realize I'm not looking at ordinary PDFs. I got into the Electronic Resource Library which is Web based.

Hello. I am not able to get a paper from library. Can you help me? Hi! Can you provide me some citation infromation information* Hohmann M. A cognitive brain-computer interface for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Progress in brain research. 2016-01-01;228:221-239. Okay, let's see if we have access to this journal Okay, it looks like we do not have access to this journal Your best bet would be to request this article through our Interlibrary loan services (ILLiad) Have you done this before? No I didn't Okay, let me get you information on this service Thanks. Here is the link to information on interlibrary loan (ILLiad) http://library.cmu.edu/using/requesting You will want to use ILLiad on the left-hand side If you haven't used the service before, you will need to create an account with some of your contact information so that we can get the article to you Okay Once that is done, simply fill out a request form for "Article" and provide all of the citation info. Our team will then find a library that access to this article and will get it to you One question, it asks me to provide address but it wants it to be non-Pittsburgh only You mean when filling out your personal information? Yes it requires a campus mailing address This could be a department address I suppose ah okay great Most of the items will be picked up at a library location or in the case of an article, it will be emailed to you when ready Thank you very much for your help You are very welcome! Is ther enything else that I can help you with today?

I'm Maryam Pakdaman 
Ph.D. candidate of information science 
I work on my thesis with this topic:
"Evaluation and ranking mobile library application" Hi Maryam. Thanks for contacting us with your question Let me check and see if we have a mobile app for the library. I'm fairly new and am still learning the system One second please Thank you Ok Okay, I did find this section on the library's website that covers mobile apps: http://library.cmu.edu/research/tools However, it looks like these are all additional tools outside of the library as opposed to a mobile app for the library itself. I am checking with the circulation desk to see if there is any additional information on this and you have Browzin in this link http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/tools/browzine

Hello. How do I have access to this journal online through this link (http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/253703)? Hi Let me take a look at the link that you sent... You should see "Online Access: Access via AMS (2005-present) as you scan down the page.  That's an active link. Got it. Thanks. Glad to help. Anything else? Yes. I want the volume before the year of 2005. However, there are only volumes after 2005. Ah!  We should have the journal in print in the Sorrells Library. I can look quickly to make sure if you'd like. Yes. hold on. I am looking for two papers. Okay ... The first one is "Reeves, R. I. "Variational Solutions for Two Nonlinear Boundary-Value Problems for Diffusion with Concentration-Dependent Coefficients." Quarterly of Applied Mathematics 33, no. 3 (1975): 291-95."  The second one is " D.A. Tarzia, An inequality for the coe´Ûcient r of the free boundary sçt_ Î_ 2r
´Û´Û
t
p
of the Neumann solution for the
two-phase Stefan problem, Quart. Appl. Math. 39 (1981) 491497." Thanks. One moment and I'll make sure the journal is actually there for you. Yes, both volumes are definitely here and your information appears to be correct. We have a walk-up scanner for you to use.  I'll have to look into digital availability of AMS journal backfiles. That would be great if digital ones are available. Thanks. Hopefully they have them available for us to purchase. That's a long-term effort though. I see. Hmm ... doesn't look promising.  Hopefully they're thinking about it. May I ask where the location of these paper-based journal is? The Sorrells Engineering & Science Library is on the 4th floor of Wean Hall. I only see "SHELVED BY TITLE." I mean where they are in the Sorrells Engineering & Science library. Yes, shelved in the "Q"'s of the journals. Back into the library and to the left. If you're headed this way, I could show you. Got it. Great!  Our front desk staff should be helpful as well. When the library is close today? 9 pm Thanks. If I cannot find them, I definitely will stop by the information desk there. You have a good day. U 2!  Always glad to help.

Hi This is Sathwik I took a book using iLLiad and tomorrow is the due date for that, is there a chance to get it re-issued online? This is the reference number: https://illiad.library.cmu.edu/illiad/illiad.dll?Action=10&amp;Form=67&amp;Value=427846 you would need to call Andre Marshal in Illiad or email him .. chances are he won't get to it until Monday, but let me get you his info yeah sure Andrew Marshall 	Resource Sharing Associate II 	amarshal@andrew.cmu.edu
+1 412 268 3030 will that be all then? In case if he is not reachable can I return it to HUNT and get it back  will that be possible? *get it back when he agrees for reissuing the copy you can return it, but you cannot check it out right away, I don't think.  It would be sent back and you'd need to re-borrow .. it's best to call him.  If it is not due until tomorrow, you have a "grace" period of a week, so you should be ok I would just wait until Monday and call/email.  You can tell him Ethan suggested that (in case there are problems) and he can talk to me. sounds good? yeah that sounds great. Just to confirm I won't be charged for using the grace period right? correct.   what school/college or department are you in? You may also ask the subject liaison for that department to purchase the item. INI Ok, so you'll need to email Ole Villadsen and ask about purchasing it. let me get you his email:  Ole Villadsen 	Librarian 	ovillads@andrew.cmu.edu
+1 412 268 8599
     Connecting Research with Researchers   	Sorrells WEH 4407 	Research & Academic Services 		 I'd get the book renewed AND contact Ole (the book purchase, if possible, may take a while).   okay sure.

im not really sure where to start honestly Hi What can I help you with? I just know that cmu has good research esp. in accessibility and legibility and online learning, so I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction Is this for a class?  no, just trying to make a good e-learning platform To get started, you can just type in accessibility "online learning" in the articles and more search box on the homepage ok, could you link me there? www.library.cmu.edu  I'll also see if I can find a better database-so you want the technical side of e-learning? yes, like research that supports chunking, or ideal paragraph lengths, ratios page to text, etc If you want very technical articles, perhaps the ACM digital Library would help.  It's in our list of Research Databases, (link under search box on front page, also under Search and Find).  Under letter "A" and just type in e-learning. awesome, thank you! oh shoot. Is there a guest log-in option? You're welcome.  No, no remote guest login. For access if you are not CMU, you need to come into the library You can get a guest ID good for 2 hours - fill out form, need current ID with expiration date That is good to know, thank you so much for your help! You're welcome. Have a good day! you too :-)

Hi. How should I go about placing a hold on the library site? Hi One moment.  Let me locate a book that is checked out so that I can guide you through step by step.  Ok? Ok, thank you. Okay, if you're looking at a list of search results ... Click on the title of the book that indicates that it is checked out ... the one that you want. Oh I'm sorry that I wasn't clear. The situation is that a librarian told me to hold a book that appears as available on the catalog because she couldn't locate it. Ah! In that case we'll need the Circulation Desk staff to place the hold.  We can't place a hold on something that is not technically checked out.  Can you send me the URL for the book from the catalog? When you have the full record up ... it will just be the URL URL for the catalog record. http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1382208/Holdings#tabnav Inside cyber warfare correct? yes Could I have your andrew id?  I'll take the book record and your id to the Circulation desk here in Sorrells and see if they can place the hold for you.  Also, I'll check the shelf before that.  It's .... maybe 40 feet from my office. My andrew ID is karleunt Okay ... you may find a copy at our SEI Library as well.  If I find the book I'll email you and have them hold it at the desk for you. Ok. Thank you very much! You're welcome.  Anything else for now? This is Matt Marsteller by the way ... a librarian in the Sorrells Library. Are you still there?  I found it on the shelf and I'll leave it for you at the Circulation Desk in the Sorrells Library (Wean Hall, 4th Floor).  Okay?

Hello! Hi IÎm looking for an iternational standad, ISO 16000 Okay ...  I've tried the search and find, but maybe there is a university wide subscription for ISO standards..? Not for ISO standards, but ... if we don't have it ... it can be requested.  For reference, I put together a guide on standards at the university at:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/standards   I hope you find it helpful.  Let me look at the situation for your standard. It's possible that it was already requested and that we already have access ... one moment. Okay ... this appears to be a multipart standard on indoor air.  Do you know which part you might need? Here is a link to records of the different parts of the standard.  It will be a good place to start.  You may wish to right click on this and open it in a separate window so that we don't lose contact.  http://www.techstreet.com/searches/9638442 I'm also going to check out the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's holdings ...  It doesn't appear that the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh has the standard that we seek. So, if we can figure out which part(s) of ISO 16000 that you need, we can order it for you.  They're a bit expensive, but the library has a small amount of money dedicated to purchasing standards each year. Hi ... are you still with me? Hi.  The chat has been inactive for quite some time, so I'm going to close the discussion.  You can reach me at matthewm@andrew.cmu.edu if you need to discuss obtaining standards.  I did note an IP address that is not affiliated with the university, so it's possible that I won't be able to help obtain the standard if you're not a member of the Carnegie Mellon University community. All the best.

Just had a quick question, is there any public access to carnegie mellon databases? Im doing some business research at my university and the level of resources is far inferior to carnegie mellon's. Just thought i'd ask! yes.  you'll need to bring your ID (a driver license would do) and ... ask for a day pass at the lending desk FYI, the Carnegie Public Library also has a downtown location (a business center) and they have even more resources there .. and open to public what if im off cite, say in canada? is there a way to get a day pass electronically ? no .. you have to be on-site .. sorry thats ok! thank you for the information! you're welcome and have a gr8 day

I am not finding AIChEJ (Journal of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers) anymore as an e-Journal.  Could you check, since I'm sure I've been able to access that in the past. Sure-just a minute please This record will have the link in it.  It didn't show up in our e-journal list, but was in our catalog.  I'll report this so it can be added to the e-journal list and not be so hard to find! http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/439547 Thank you.  It looks like it worked. Great-that's good to hear! It is inour e-journal list-but this is the title  AIChE journal so next time you need it, just type  AIChE!

hi hello How may I help you? i am a new student and trying to figure out where to go to get the following book Engineering &amp; Science Library - STACKS http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/761419 Welcome to CMU! thank you Okay, let me take a look at the book my office is at mellon institute, but i am not sure whether this is in the mellon library, the sorrels library, or the hunt library This particular book is in the Sorrels Library in Wean Hall I can get you directions in a second Here are the locations of all of our libraries:http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/locations sounds good, i think i found it Sorrels is the 2nd library listed. Sorry, here's the link again: http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/locations how long are books usually issued for? Are you a graduate student or an undergrad? also, is it possible to request new books, which are currently not available i am a graduate student Graduates get books for 90 days with one renewal (another 90 days) ok, 6 months sounds like plenty of time You can request books that we don't have using our interlibrary loan service Here is some more information on our ILL services: http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting ok, how long are ILL books issued for? That will depend on the lending institution's library. It can vary Most books circulate for 3 weeks i see, is that the same for renewals? of ILL books It will also depend on the institution ok, thank you i'm off to get this book have a nice day

I am trying to locate a book by Carol Albright which is a culimination of different articles about Italian American Immigrants.  I was with my instructor yesterday and she pulled it up, I cannot find it now.  Could you help me? Hi Sure-are you sure of the author's name-Carol Albright, and sure of the spelling? Also, she sent me some links, but they won't work.  Here are a couple: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-c576-24b2bbed14012a2d92b45ea3a565f1362e526d88c44db5d2a375596da64d8a4d2 YEs that is the correct spelling. OK-just a minute, let me look for some things. Here's a book we have by Carol Albright and others: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1015343 Title is American Women, Italian Style.  I know she pulled it up on her computer, can't get it now. She actually sent me the link via the library site: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-a46787-f7e1dcd0a39018e1040cec27beed1346dce9d09f22bf6210471ac121f6e2dff53  But when I click on it, there is an error message. OK-let me check something else Came up for me ;-) OK, so how can I get to the TOC to see what article/s or chapter/s I would want?? I see, this is an article on a book we probably don't have.  I believe on our homepage she searched "everything," which would pull up articles (they appear on the right side of the screen) and books we have (they appear on the left hand side of the screen). And it's actually an e-book It's an e-book to which we have access Duhh, I was able to get to the TOC, sorry.  So I can print what I want since its an e-book, right?? Well you didn't tell me that!!!  Yes, you should be able to get to the text of the book-where it says download. The big problem might be authentication,  Are you on campus? Yep, I'm in Baker Hall.  I work in the Psych Dept. are you on a laptop or a PC with   CMU IP address? I'm on a Mac computer.  Do you have a hard copy of the book?  Would save a lot of paper? No, we don't have it in paper, but you could get it via EZ Borrow in 3-5 days.  If you wait a sec, I can see if it's in a local library (Pitt or CLP) where you could walk to and get. That would be wonderful--thanks so much! No, sorry, not many have the paper and no one nearby.  I mean, you could still do ILL for the paper. Put in a request, and it comes in in about a week.  Do you need to read the whole book or just a chapter?  You can read the e-book online or download it (and save/print) I need it this weekend to work on a paper for a class.  But that's a good idea--I will download it and save it and read it on line.  Thanks so much--much appreciated.  You've been a great help.  One last thing--could you tell me what search words I could use on Cameo to find more of this kind of info?  Italian immigrants (women) in particular Sure-just a minute let me try some keywords Italian American women (this is a really specific search)  My instructor use quotation marks and plus signs and came up with a bunch of stuff. italian immigration  (broader search, but you'll still get relevant info. Even though women may not be in the title, chapters, etc. may deal with them) quotation marks around two words will get you that exact phrase.  OK, so that makes sense.  And the + sign would be all the words you do a search on?  Sounds, great--thanks very much for your help and time.  Hope you have a great day. You can also click on the subject headings that are listed on the record, and these will bring up similar abooks You're welcome! Glad to help! Signing off now--thanks again! You're welcome-have a great day! :-)

Hi, I am searching journals for my research paper reference but it seems that the system is offline. Could you confirm that?  hi Let me check I've successfully done searches in "everything" "articles and more" "books and more."  Is there a specific database you're trying to use? Hmm, Yeah. It seems to be working again for me as well. Previously I would get an error message saying that the name of the search could not be resolved.  Glad it's working. It's like when  you have a non stop cough, you do to the doctor...no cough.  Yeah. haha. Anyways, thanks for the help Glad it's working for you.   And we have no trouble testing for you whenever you suspect there's a problem. Have a great day-get out and enjoy the nice weather! :-) Yeah. You too! Thx! :-)

Hello - I'm a reference librarian at GT Law in DC and I'm preparing a presentation for Carnegie Mellon students who are studying in DC this semester on legislative history and legal research.  (Their prof is an alum from GT Law &amp; he wants to introduce them to a law library/legal research.) hi I noted that Carnegie Mellon has ProQuest Congressional - does that include Legislative Insight? If so, I'd like to show them how to use it for legislative history research &amp; let them know they have access to it &amp; help using it at Carnegie Mellon. No, I don't believe it does-it's "just" Proquest Congressional-hearings, legislative history,  ok - that's still really helpful for leg research! I did make a guide for policy research-let me see if it helps identify what we have in that area.  I just discovered the subject category we made in our A-Z database list Law/Legal has disappeared....something to investigate after this chat!!~ lol - that always happens! If this helps (it may not, more policy): http://guides.library.cmu.edu/policyanalysis I'll be happy to include whatever is avail at Carnegie Mellon for them We have HeinOnline databases ...you know, if you give me your email, I'll be happy to note what we have in this area and do screen shots-chat doesn't let me do that.  Sure - roj2@georgetown.edu Rachel Jorgensen Thanks for your help! This way you could get a really clear idea of what we have (e.g. which HeinOnline dbs), etc. Thanks so much! That's perfect!   I think it will be the easiest way! Hope it helps! :-) While we don't have a law school, we do sometimes get law questions, we also rely on U of Pitt's law school library down the street.  We don't have WestLaw, for example. That's good to know - I'm going to explain how proprietary the law databases are Yeah...really!! LOL!!  I've just sent you email with our law/legal resources, with screen shots so you can see what they actually have access to.   We have laws, hearings, really don't have cases per se. Got it! They should have more than enough access for what they're working on - Great!  And while I'm sure they can get access to better stuff there, just as an FYI, all can access these databases remotely-we use EZ proxy so they just need to logon with their Andrew user IDs and passwrds. Just curious, Rachel, which prof is this? Fred Crawford I'm not sure if he's an adjunct Don't know him....ah-there he is in our directory-staff with our CMU Washington Semester Program!  This is the first time we've gotten this request And this is the first time we've gotten any type of question re the Washington Semester program.  I sent you an email with ways they/you/etc can contact us-chat (duh) we also have a reference email huntref@andrew.cmu.edu and while we don't have a librarian liaison to that particular program, they can also email me if need be.  We're happy to help whenever we can. Great!  I'll let you know how it goes (scheduled for next Monday evening)  Hopefully it will encourage them to work with you all Awesome!  I'll be interested in hearing the outcome. Thanks for all you're doing for our students! I'm sure you have enough on your plate with your own GT law students. They're on spring break this week, so it's worked out kind of perfectly. Excellent-our spring break too!  Thank you again for your help!  Have a great day - You too, Rachel, you have a good day as well!

Hi Hello I would like to know if any CMU library has copies of Harvard Business review on file I mean printed copies of an issue. I know I can access some articles online, but I am looking for one that is not available through ebscohost.com We do have access from 1922 to the present in electronic format, but let me check on print. Oh, that's way. I am looking for a 1990 article. Thank you why* Use the e-Journals list on the library's home page.  That will guide you to it. http://xx4ay4fv5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&issn=&title=Harvard%20Business%20School%20Cases&volume=&issue=&date=19900701&atitle=Perceptual%20Mapping%3A%20A%20Manager%27s%20Guide.&spage=1&pages=1-11&sid=EBSCO:Business%20Source%20Premier&au=Dolan,%20Robert%20J. There is a get it a CMU full text, but no link to the file Also, the Hunt Library has back to 1922 in print on the 3rd floor. oh ok Thank you Let me check out your link. Ah ... you're looking for a Harvard Business School Case.  That's a different thing. Yes. I had not realized that. Sorry. Is there a way to access it only, or a printed copy at a CMU library? online* I'm checking.  Let me see if I can catch Roye Werner in her office. Thank you If your professor has provided it, it will be available via him/her.  I'm going to forward you to Roye now ...  :-) No, unfortunately this is something I am researching on my ow. Thanks own* Hi there - Roye here -  Hi Roye Let me take a look at that link - just a minute I am trying to access a Business School Case, but cannot find it. Oh ok. Thank you Got it.  Yes, it s true that Harvard doesn't allow libraries to distribute its case studies.  The only way to get them is through your class, if your professor has assigned them - or else to purchase them directly from the site - https://hbr.org/product/a/an/590121-PDF-ENG however, if this is something that you are researching, and would be willing to use another research source, we'll be glad to help Thank you. I did find a couple of other articles available on HBR, but was confused as why this one was not But I understand that this is a case and not an article now Thanks a lot for your help! exactly.  Google Scholar has a number of articles on perceptual mapping also. you're very welcome ok. I will contact you again in case I need additional help thnaks agian please do - either here or email rwerner@andrew.cmu.edu Thank you. Have a good rest of the day You too!

Hello! Is there a way to view a table of contents for a book  on the library website by any chance? Hi.  Some of our catalog records include tables of contents. If you're looking for a particular book, I could check other places as well.  If needed. Often the table of contents is available from the publisher ... for recent books especially. Unfortunately it's from 1975... http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/37738/Holdings#tabnav - the theory of environmental policy Let me see what I can do ... thank you Give me a couple of minutes ... Here's the second edition:  http://assets.cambridge.org/97805213/11120/toc/9780521311120_toc.pdf unfortunately checked out :| i was curious how closely chapter 11 in 1st ed matched 2nd ed. ah well, i think i'll just bite the bullet and come by and hope it matches thank you for your help! Sure ... I'm still digging for the table of contents for the 1975 edition - is that the 1st?  If I find it could I send it via email? yes, that's the first edition and i'll be here for a few more minutes while i'm wrapping up something else, so if you do find it, then i would be very grateful if you pass it along here I'm just not having any luck ... bummer.  Is our copy checked out? yeah oh, sorry, no, i'm going to come by now & get the 1st edition Oh good!   If it's a long way, I could possibly stop by Hunt and capture the Table of Contents on my phone camera and send it to you. I'll be leaving in ... maybe 20 minutes or so.

Hi, I'm starting class on August 31st as a graduate student, so I'm unfamiliar with CMU. OK. Did you have a particular quesiton? question At PSU, the library had 2 hour book rentals within a special section of the library. Is that the case here too? My first required textbook is Second language learning
theories (3rd ed) You might be referring to course reserves. These are materials that a professor places on hold for a course. And yes, they are lent out for 2-hour periods and must be used on-site. Have you tried searching for this item in the catalog? http://library.cmu.edu Where is that located and how do I find out if my professors do that? http://library.cmu.edu click on the tab that says "Books & More" When the results come up, click on the title that you need. The record will  indicate whether it's already been placed as a course reserve or whether you can take it off the stacks yourself. In the event that it's already been processed as a reserve item, you can request it at the circulation desk (the front desk), to the left of the entrance of Hunt Library. Oh yes, now I see it. They have the 2nd edition as opposed to the third, but that should probably still be okay. You may also check the holdings at the Univ. of Pittsburgh, as you have reciprocal borrowing privileges over there. Internet
Publisher description (off-campus link) 
Hunt Library - STACKS-2 (Stacks 2nd Floor)
Call Number:	P118.2 .M58 2004	 Where is it?
Copy 1	
Available
Copy 2	
Available http://www.library.pitt.edu/ The record you copied and pasted indicated that we have two copies located on the 2nd floor of Hunt. That's not reserve, correct? That's great that there's reciprocity. Should I message the professor and ask her to place the 3rd edition in course reserves? Correct re: reserve. If it had already been placed on reserve by your professor, the record would normally indicate this. But as the semester has not yet started, perhaps your professor hasn't gotten around to it. yet. Okay, thank you very much. That was extremely helpful. You're very welcome.

Hello, I am doing research for the CIRP and was wondering if the library had access to data from Lloyd's List Intelligence. I am looking for data on oil transit volumes through certain trade routes, and APEX database on Lloyd's List Intelligence seems to have this information, but I need to register to have access. Does the library have access to this data? hi which department are you in? Decision Science you may wish to contact apaulos2@andrew.cmu.edu, the librarian for that department As far as I can tell, we don't have access to the database, but he may be able to point you to other resources Ok thank you you're welcome

Hi, I have a question about Chicago style citations.  If I am using a published study that does not have an author listed, am I supposed to begin the citation with the title of the study or with the organization that conducted the study? just a minute and I'll find out  Thank you! I am supposed to use the 15th edition Manual of style  On this page - https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/03/ see "Anonymous Works"  - also on the left it has more information on the Chicago Manual of Style citations Thank you!  That appears to be the 16th edition - don't know if it's a problem   We have the 15th edition in Hunt Library - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/196523 Is there a way to access the 15th edition? I'm a student at the DC campus  Ah - we don't have it online (it's from 2003) but there may be some help site out there  - just a minute and I'll look (s (Still, I imagine that the principle regarding what to do with anonymous works is the same :-)) http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/15/ch17/ch17_toc.html that looks like it will work - see anonymous works Thank you! I'll keep looking. This requires login information.  I appreciate your help.  are you sure?  it's free from here  Yeah maybe because I am not on the CMU network  I can probably access it with VPN  indeed, or else try this link: http://search.library.cmu.edu/link/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html  and click the box for 15th edition at the right That worked!  Thank you!  you're welcome!

Good afternoon I am searching for a book chapter Hi http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4757-9027-6_4 I could not find it in the library catalog Could you please help? Yes, let me check for you.  I'll see if we have access via our SpringerLink research database.  Hold one. Unfortunately, we don't have access to all of the Springer e-books and it would appear that this is in one of the collections that we haven't purchased.  You can request the book chapter via Interlibrary Loan though. Have you used Interlibrary Loan yet? Yes I have. Thanks for checking. Glad to help.  Wish we had access. Can I ask for an e-book via ILL as well? In this case, the chapter would be the way to go.  ILL of the entire e-book is ... not likely.  We should likely consider which other Springer e-books collections to purchase.  I don't think we have their Medicine/Life Sciences collection. Thanks. I would only need this chapter. I would place an order via ILL.  This is a physics book Thanks a lot  and have a happy holiday Yes, I have problems with Springer's categorizations.  :-) You and I would call it physics... Springer .... I'm sure they didn't. Yes, happy holidays. :) We have purchased their "physics collection."

Hi! Do you guys have the Norton Shakespeare Tragedies book? let me check one moment ok thanks! Do you mean this edition? http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1038435 We have this at our Qatar campus or do you mean another edition? Do you have that at the cmu campus? Or something similar? no the one I pointed out is not at CMU campus. Have you looked in our library catalog? you might want to browse? unless you have a specific book in mind? http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/451065 for instance we have this text - link I just sent It is a Norton text at Hunt Library You might want to check Hunt Library 2nd floor stacks under falling number:  PR2751  in the PR2751 section, I mean... also  Ok I'll browse! Thank you! you could email the English librarian  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/English Ok! If I don't find it, I'll do that!

Good afternoon--Does CMU have a subscription to the Oxford English Dictionary? Hi I'm fairly certain that we do.  Let me double check. Would you also minding checking if it is online? Do you mean if it is working at the moment? We do have online access.  The simplest way to gain access (for me) is to use our list of Research Databases - a link is on our library home page just under the Search Box. You can use the A to Z listing and look under "O."  It's under OED: Oxford English Dictionary in the listing. Sorry, where would I find the A-Z listing? On the library's main page you'll see a blue "Everything" search box.  Just under that is a link for "Research Databases". Clicking on the list will bring up the A to Z listing. Clicking on the "link" (not list)...

Hello? Does CMU have access to the Proquest archive for the Atlantic Monthly? I need an Atlantic article that was published in 1950  hi hi there Let me check how far back our holdings go-just a minute, please. thanks so much Hi-don't have it electronically back that far (only back to 1971 via Proquest), but we do have in paper (you'll need to request from offsite) or on microfilm (which is on the 3rd floor of Hunt).  Here's the record: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/268103/Holdings#tabnav thank you so much You're very welcome! is there a list, just in general, of which publications (magazines and newspapers) CMU has available digitally?  Absolutely! From our homepage, click on Search and find, and then e-journals by titles...or use this link: http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/eJournals Just remember that we still do have items in paper and microform, so if you don't find your title in that e-journals list, use the catalog In the catalog, the advanced search may make searching a bit easier: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Advanced brilliant, thank you again! glad to help! :-) And of course, you can always ask for help if you need us to double check!

Hello, I wonder if this book: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1577882 is available for students to use inside the library? let me check one momen  thank you Yes on reserve at Hunt Library Hunt Library - HL-CIRCDK -- (Hunt Library circ desk) check at Hunt Library front desk for a copy use 2 hr in library according to our catalog record...4 copies on reserve but you can contact Hunt Library staff to verify http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/reserves Ok thank you Have a good day. Thanks for your help

Hello! I had a question about borrowing the following book: "A Practical Introduction to Hardware/Software Codesign" (2010) HI! WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION Sorry accidentally hit all caps No worries, I figured that was probably it :) Looking on the catalog, there are three different versions of this (1 ebook, 2 book chapters) The book in question is actually a full textbook, however, so I'm not sure if they contain the full book The eBook has a DOI lookup as an external link, but the link leads to an error page So I'm not sure how to proceed  Okay, are you specifically looking at the 2010 version? Yes I should probably mention that I am off campus right now, and not using the library VPN Which might change the eBook access Okay. You should still be able to access it even off campus through ez proxy Were you asked to log in with your Andrew ID and password at some point when trying to access? I was not-- I'm logged in at the moment to my email/Blackboard, so I didn't need to log in when I was putting books on hold? And no log in prompts came after that I see.  Did you try and access it through the library's catalog, or through your blackboard site? through the library catalog Okay. That is a little weird because I was able to click on the DOI link through the library's catalog and got right into the eBook May I ask which DOI link you were using? Or which edition of the eBook Sure! I selected the link to the 2010 edition of the book and clicked on the DOI link under the word "Internet" Oh! Thank you very much. That link was working What should have happened though is that once you click on that link from off-campus, you should have to log in with your Andrew ID and CMU password as a verification mechanism before gaining access Interesting! Let me try the other link to see Let me see if I can find where the broken link was in case you need it Thanks, that would be great! I just tried the other link in that record and it worked too. Maybe just a temporary glitch? Hopefully so! I clearly remember getting an "Incorrect DOI" error page though so I'm thinking there is probably a typo somewhere Interesting.  Let us know if you run into that again sometime...we can fix that :) I'm not sure if this is an error or not, but the address after Link in this entry requires an iLibrary login, and I wasn't able to find CMU institutional access:  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-a20440-3836ca74928425a6cc22a6b78db0a124f4faf556c3c2b217dc09cd4f86cbf3903 Sorry for the poorly formatted link No worries! This looks like a result from the Articles and More option instead of the Books option In this case the "Link" section does not work, but the "Full Text" link next to "Get It @ CMU" does After a redirect of course haha Fair enough! Interesting though, I can let our tech people know. Thanks for reporting this! I'm trying to remember what it was that I had searched previously, but I don't want to take up more of your time No worries at all. It may have been a result from an "Everything" search too, which searches both books and articles If I find the broken link, should I just submit it to one of the emails given? on the Ask Us page? That would work well, and then we can forward it to the appropriate people for fixing :) Oh! I found the error page, anyway: http://dx.doi.org.proxy.library.cmu.edu/10.1007/9781461437376 Hmm...I can't seem to see what this DOI is for though I'm going through my history now to see if I can figure out what redirected to it Okay Would it be okay to send that link to one of our email addresses with a short explanation? I have to attend a meeting. Sorry! No worries! Yes, I can do that Sorry to hold you up! No worries at all! Thanks again for contacting us :)

I use library.cmu.edu and was trying to get a pdf from Physics Letters B and the indication was I could purchase it.  That has not happened before.  I Emailed the issue to the library site and a reply indicated I should go through "Cameo" but I cannot find any link actually called "Cameo".  (I'm off site.) let me check Perhaps they were referring to these items: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/253410 http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/443719 Should I click on those now? Yes, these are records from the catalog that contain links to the online.  The last one I sent is Physics Letters B 1976-present. You'll see the link at the bottom of the record. Okay.  It got me to CAMEO.  I bookmarked it now.  But how come I couldn't find any link to CAMEO following my usual use of the library site? I'm not sure what you mean.  I went to the libraries' homepage, limited to books and other items (that is the library catalog, essentially) and typed in physics litters b I do that under "ejournals".  The journal comes up but when I get to the issue and article I'm interested in the only pdf download option that appears does so under a "Purchase" link. What issue or article are you interested in-we may not have all that you need electronically. 
NEUTRINO ASTRONOMY AND LEPTON CHARGE
By: GRIBOV, V; PONTECORVO, B
PHYSICS LETTERS B   Volume: B 28   Issue: 7   Pages: 493-+   Published: 1969  This came up fine for me.  Are you on campus? and if not, did you not get a prompt to login and authentiate? If you send me your email addesss I can send it to you I'm off campus.  I got a login prompt when accessing the library site, used my andrew ID and pass word, but then got another login request next to the "Purchase" option as an alternative to purchase.  I did not login a second time because I figured a different login/pw was needed. When you found the article, did you look for a download link? No, it should have all worked for you once you logged in. When I found the article, it offered the PDF, which I clicked on and it opened right away. I'm at pk03@andrew.cmu.edu This has happened before and it was suggested that I use VPN, but I've never had to do that.  I download promiscuously so this "denial" was a shock. Article is on its way.  I'll report this to the Physics librarian-maybe he knows something.  Maybe just a one time fluke, esp. if you've never had problems before.  Thanks mucho.  Over and out. You're very welcome-enjoy!

hello, I was wondering how I can find research papers on optimal settings for online learning Hi! May I ask where you have looked so far? Have you looked in any library databases? no, just in the "find ejournals" area Ah I see. 

How do I register for access to your research journal libraries? hi are you a cmu student, faculty, or staff? if not, just come to the lending desk and show an id .. for temporary access otherwise, use your CMU ID No, I'm a computer science masters student at Norfolk State University trying to conduct online research for my thesis paper. good :) and welcome anything else I can help with? Yes, can I get access to the library? I'm in Norfolk, Virginia in person use, yes .. so you can look at our books .. can't check out unless you buy a special member .. So, I can't use the online database......right? yes, that's what you'll show your ID for .. you get a temp pass  So, I need to enter my student ID number for NSU in order to register an account? no .. just a photo ID  a license will do Which tab do I select, exactly? you have to be at the library you can't do it online That's what I conveyed earlier when I stated that I'm physically in Virginia, not Pittsburgh. Hello?

my teacher said own textbook was available through the library for download. how do i download the pdf of the book? hello what is the title of your book? you'll need to look it up in the library catalog. Intermolecular and surface forces : with applications to colloidal and biological systems You may be able to download a chapter or the whole book, depends on the publisher. http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/216592 if you are off campus, you'll need to log in when you click on the link, you should see Access Online this one is a print copy on reserve here's the online copy: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1475390 you can click on the link that says "online access" thank you sure .. anything else? do i need to create an account to download it? it brought me to another website http://site.ebrary.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/lib/cmu/detail.action?docID=10478352 yes.

how can i get the book the bastard by erskine caldwell on my computer? hi Let me see if we have an electronic copy. We don't seem to have an electronic copy.  I'm not even sure we have a paper copy-we don't have a work by that title alone, can't tell from the records if it's in any of his collections. thank you for your help. You're welcome. If you need a paper copy, I can check local libraries for you if you'd like. If no local library has, there are other options  http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting that would be great. No one seems to have it locally-closest is Penn State.  If you did EZ Borrow, you could have it in 3-5 days. Interlibrary loan might take a little longer since we do the searching, processing, etc. With EZ borrow, you logon, search a joint catalog, find an available copy and place the request.   Here's the information you'd need if you were to do ILL: Book	The bastard 
Author: Caldwell, Erskine, 1903-1987.; Mahon, Ty,
Publication: New York, Heron Press 1929 i really appreciate this. i am not a student, and a beginner in computers. i wil go to my local ibrary and request it. if i get lucky, Penn State will end it out. thanks again! You're welcome.  If you are not affiliated with CMU, your local library will be able to do interlibrary loan for you. thanks again. have a nice day.  Thanks, You as well! 

Hi, I'm trying to get an article from a scientific journal. The CMU library doesn't have it and neither does CAMEO. Is there another method I can use to get it by today? Hi Ooooh, today is tough.  Can you send me the citation and I'll double check you and see if Pitt has. https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242525104&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=DD9F335BE69BC3B2614B9B190D88BBE3.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1 It is actually available to download here on this website, but it seems a little sketchy it said that my version of chrome isn't supported even though it's the most updated version didn't work on firefox, and i couldn't figure out how to change the security settings on safari to allow me to download Which website?  Just give a few minutes to check things out. https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242525104&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=DD9F335BE69BC3B2614B9B190D88BBE3.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1 My Chrome is doing the freezing thing...please be patient-need to move over to Firefox. alright, thank you Hi, I just want to make sure you're still here Hello? yes! Sorry, problems with browser.  Sorry to take so long I was trying many things. sadly, closest copy is Penn State.  If you had more time we could get via interlibrary loan, but for today....sorry, not possible.  Let me know if you want link for interlibrary loan. ah i see are you able to check any university that has a copy of it? and if they have a copy of it, does that mean a student there can get digital access to it? Oh-I see what you mean.  Let me see what info I can get from Penn State's system.  Usually if a library has a digital copy, unless we do interlibrary loan, you'd have to go to that university to use it.  There's no way you here @ CMU would be able to use a digital copy @ PSU  (unless you knew someone there and they gave you password or sent you copy, etc.). yeah that's what i'm trying to do i have a good friend at caltech and uc irvine that could possibly do that for me No going to work....PSU's is a paper copy that is in their offsite repository, so it would have to be requested from there Proceedings of the 2001 Bioengineering Conference: presented at Snowbird, Utah, June 27-July 1, 2001
by Kamm, Roger D
2001
Conference Proceeding
:
Submit Request for Annexed Material, R856.A1B43 v.50, Annex (UP)  Oh-let me check for Caltech Libraries in CA that have it: Stanford, UC Davis, UCLA do you know if its digital or hard copy? UCLA paper Stanford paper offsite storage UC Davis paper oh boy haha i don't think that's going to work then alright, i'll try to ILL then. Thank you so much for your help You're welcome.  Here's a link to the ILL service http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting You'll want to use ILLiad. do you think it would possible to get it by tomorrow? my paper is due tomorrow and this journal article has exactly what i need to write it. but if i don't get it by tomorrow, i need to start looking for other sources I really doubt it, esp. since some of these places have it offsite.  This is how it works: Your request goes on the bottom of our pile, and then goes out to library and goes on the bottom of their pile.  They have to get it from offsite (if PSU), copy it, then send to us.  I have no idea how big ILL piles are now (desperate students in same situation as yourself)...and how many staff are on vacation, out sick, etc.  It's so hard to give exact times.  Best to start looking for other sources.   Alright, cool. Thanks again for your help have a great day :) You're very welcome.  Have a good day and good luck on your paper-I'm sure you'll do well!! :-)

Hi Hi How can I help you? Would you be able to help me find some materials as I am unsure where to look. What do you know about what you're looking for? I tried calling but no answer from reference dept. I am looking to see if I can find any recent industry analysis / reports on the bicycle industry. Either US or Global These are typically trade focused reports where they talk about trends etc and report on growth type numbers Ah!  Okay.  I know the first place we ought to start.  In a moment, I'll share a link with you.  Right click on it and open it in another window so that we don't lose contact, okay? ok great thanks! Here is the Business and Economics Librarian's Industries page:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries ok Where would we start? In the center box there are a number of databases with market research reports and other related literature. ok - any suggestions of sources you think will be particularly pertinent ? Let's each try one and see what we can find.  This at least gives us a short list to work from.  If you are concerned about taking too long, our best person to talk to is Ryan Splenda, our Business and Economics Librarian. Hmm... Why don't you start with IbisWorld.  I'll look for another. ok will do not bad but it is very high level summary. I am looking for something a little more comprehensive probably a stand alone report I tried First Research Industry Profiles ... I'm getting a broader report on fitness equipment. Have you looked at the different tabs that are across the top of the report? yeah I am scrolling through those... To be more specific I am interested in bicycle component manufacturing.... Ah ...  I've tried the report from IbisWorld for Bicycle Dealership and Repair, thinking that might get into at least the repair parts.  Looks a lot like the other report. yeah I tried that too.  I am trying ABI/INFORM Collection Ok ... we might try to find the right NAICS number for parts manufacturing for bicycles ... if we can. good idea Web site is sloooow it is a little. By the way I am Andy adjunct faculty over in DC. This is Matt (ECE, Math and Physics Librarian).  The NAICS code ... 336991 Motorcycle, Bicycle, and Parts Manufacturing  - they've got bikes mixed in with mopeds and motorcycles!  Not good. aghhh! Yeah ... I had a bit of a potty-mouth incident.  Apologies about your Capitals by the way.  We really wanted the Penguins to win though. A small amount of the right stuff:  http://clients1.ibisworld.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/reports/us/industry/productsandmarkets.aspx?entid=856 Bicycles and related parts Lots of repeat information.   Let me try another database. I wasn't thinking of high technology.  Perhaps you'd find Frost & Sullivan interesting.  Nanotech for bike frames  stuff like that. i will look at the frost and sullivan reports but they are mor ehigh tech I'll try some more... thanks Seemed to strike out with Marketline. I've tried to see if Ryan Splenda would have a chance to answer an email...  One more idea. Do u think its worth me setting up time for a 1-2-1 as I see you can request a research consultation With Ryan?  Absolutely!  He's a pretty awesome business librarian. I was kind of striking out too before I reached out. Do you want me to give you my cell number or email and you can maybe speak to him. My other idea was to try using our discovery tool ... now I'm realizing that 3-D parts manufacturing would even be having a big impact on parts.  That was one of the first things that came up. yes exactly.... we are looking at how modern manufacturing processes create a huge opportunity to bring back high end component manufacturing from Asia Sure, I would gladly pass it along.  I think he might be in Toronto at a conference for business librarians at the moment, but he might be back. 99percent are bow made in Taiwan/China andrewr2@andrew.cmu.edu  301.828.8858 If you can pass that along that would be awesome my name is Andy Richman I'll be sure to pass that along then.  Try the discovery tool.  That's the main search box on the library's main site ... i cannot see that i am on the main library.cmu.edu and still cannot see it It's the Everything Search Box  Or, you could use Articles & More. Everything will lead you to Articles & More though ... And at least one of the ebooks looks interesting. can you send me link Look for the search box in the big splash of blue:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/ Dark blue. It usually kind of sucks for business searches, but this might be an exception. Actually, maybe only the top few hits were good. And some of them might be to market research reports outside of our normal holdings.  The $3,000 plus type of reports. Yes exactly. Its some of these crazy expensive reports I want to try and put my hands on. I presume I cannot access any of these through cmu library? Some perhaps, if you recognize if they're something like Frost & Sullivan or BCC Research.  If not, Ryan does deal with questions like this a lot (and finds alternative information).  You should at least get a table of contents. Ok so let him have my details and say it will be much appreciated Could u send me the link to that ebook cannot find it Sure.  One moment.  Oh!  It's actually a video look at the Brampton bike plant:  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1780073 So you know - I am actually British and Brompton are an incredible company You might enjoy the video then ... part of our new streaming service "Kanopy." There is a HUGE bicycle renaissance in UK and I am working on doing it here too. I have some CMU folks helping me on this...! Good!  Bikable and walkable work for me. Too bad I have a 20+ mile commute.  :-( Can i download from Kanopy? 20 miles is nothing...! ;) I get tired driving to work! Kanopy streams the video to you ... it ought to be fine with a fairly normal internet connection. I would hope that it wouldn't buffer a lot.  I'd be disappointed. Watch the video yourself and then sell the car and buy a Brompton much cheaper and you will be as fit as a fiddle Ok I going to get out of here. Don't tell my wife! Thanks for your help! Hope Ryan can contact you soon. cheers Andy bye Take care

Hello.  I think I am logged in via the vpn portal.  In the MMM program.  Need to use search engines proquest, ABInform, or Web of science.  How do I find them on your site?   hello go to library.cmu.edu under the search box, you'll see a link to Research databases It will take you to an A-Z link of databases let me know if you need further assistance please thanks

Hi. How do I get access to the online O'Reilly Safari catalog through the CMU Library? he Sorry - hi - we have a link to it with our databases  - just a sec and I'll get it ok It's listed with the research databases as Safari Books Online - http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?a=s The books are also individually listed by title and author in the catalog - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Advanced OK - do I have to sign in with my cmu id somewhere first or does the proquest site redirect me as needed to log in? If you use the link from the catalog, and you are off campus - it will just direct you first to the authentication screen which asks for your andrew username and pw.  If you're on the campus network, you'll just access it directly. OK - Thanks!

12:16 me I sought Matt Grossmann, Artists of the Possible, on Cameo on line, under the Author category. Response was no such holding. I sought then under title, Artists of the Possible. I found it in the collection with call number, although with author's name listed as Matthew Grossmann, not Matt Grossman. Took the book out, and the book itself, title page for instance, lists author as Matt Grossman. So I'm asking you, out of curiosity, how these two inconsistencies between Cameo and on-the-ground reality may have occurred. John Modell

12:31 me Might we each save some time if we shifted to ordinary e-mail? The chat seems to take many minutes to swallow what you're pasting into it. This is, as I said, only a matter of curiosity to me (about how the library works), and has no urgency about it, except insofar as curiosity is a somewhat urgent frame of mind. My e-mail is exigent@andrew.cmu.edu. if you'd be OK with shifting to this.

Hello, is anyone there? yes, I'm here Hello! I found an error in an article I have on the "Research Showcase". I am John W. Kowalski, but the name on the "Research Showcase" reference is "Jon D. Kowalski". The error can be seen here: http://repository.cmu.edu/machine_learning/48/ You'll need to contact Katie Behrman, the Research Showcase Coordinator.  She can be reached at kbehrman@andrew.cmu.edu or   412 268 2536. The name on the "Research Showcase" is incorrect. Ok, thanks.  I'll contact here. her. You're welcome.  

Hi, I'm trying to find major suppliers and their market share in the pesticides and fertilizer industry. I have the impression that there is a data base for that. Do you happen to know the data base name? Thank you very much! hi yes you should start with the business research guide and look for industry .. let me get you started with a couple of links to these guides .. give me a minute This guide has various tabs, one of which is "industries" and should help get you started .. http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper Thank you soooo much! I have been searching for this for a long time oh .. if you're at our website, on the right, there's a link that says research guides just for feature reference :) Please let us know if we can provide more assistance I'm not sure if this data base exist...     Is there a data base for regulations and standard testing methods to measure the degradation of polymer to soil to evaluate the environmental impacts?  which department are you with?  I am asking because your liaison librarian may be able to answer that and I can connect you with her/him. I'm in materials science department, but this is a course under Civil/Environmental ok, you'll need to email Lynn Berard .. do you know her? Her email is lberard@andrew.cmu.edu It's called Environmental Nanotechnology, so I'm not sure which department this belongs to no worries .. start with Lynn .. :) Thank you!! Have a nice day! you too

hello I am trying to access a book via its url, but I cannot do so; no book appears in the data base. this is the book: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1651569 Hello. Dacha idylls living organically in Russia's countryside? yes, that's the book.  Unfortunately, we do not have access to that title any longer. We have been working to have the record removed from the catalog. I see. thank you. I will place an ILL order. Oh wait! I may have spoken too soon. ? yes? Try this link: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnddw oh wonderful. many thanks! No problem. have a nice day Same to you!

Hello, I was wondering if you could answer a question about Endnote "online"  thanks What is your question? I noticed that CMU students have access to it. I am working on a research project and would find it very helpful to use it, but I am unable to download the file onto my computer. I was under the impression there is an online use version, do we have access to that as well? The Library does not have subscription. Ethan Pullman is the Librarian who is well versed on such issues. Please contact him. His email address is ethanp@cmu.edu thanks

I just got the following on trying to access "Accounts of Chemical Research":  USER ALERT: No Access to ACS Publications Hello Let me look into this for you. Before I begin -- are you working on of off campus? yes Sorry on or off? way off OK. Did you go to ACS through the library website or are you using the Library Resources VPN? Library website.  I had just finished looking at the American Journal of Physics and switched to my next journal choice Are you looking for a specific article? Nope.  Just my routine brousing. OK. If you search for Accounts of Chemical Research in Cameo, you should be able to click on the link and access the title. From Cameo, you should be asked for your Andrew ID and Password before entering the ACS site. I am on campus and had no problems accessing the journal. You can also use the Library Resources VPN. http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/offcampus Okay.  It's just that the response was strange, suggesting that excessive downloading was the culprit. Let me know if you get it again. Were you excessively downloading? ;) Nope.  Never. I'll try the VPN access.  Thanks.  Bye. Let me know if it doesn't work. We can investigate further.

I'm trying to access ebook http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1051119 HI Clicking on the like just brings me to a Kovel website Yeah, let me check into this.  sometimes e-book vendors drop books from their database and/or change urls  without telling us.  Let me take a closer look. There is another edition that is shown checked out Yes, but that later edition is an e-book, and I was able to bring up text from it.  Try the link in this record.  Sometimes our e-books are for more than one user at a time. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1748042 OK thanks

288 - 295 yes, I see that ok great We don't have that journal .. you'd have to request an inter-library loan, are you familiar with the service? yes, but just to confirm, I can't get a pdf of the paper in questions? not from our library.  another can scan it and send you a pdf .. Also, I see that pitt has it, but let me check if they have the volume you need ah .. Pitt has it online, but you have to go to Hillman, give them your CMU ID and request a day pass to their databases. This will allow you to access their online subscription and download the aritcle.

All good. Thank you. I just submitted a request on the interlibrary loan -- hopefully they will get me a pdf file, but I will be also happy with the actual journal.. whatever works Anyway, thank you! you're welcome

Hi. I have added a couple E-texts to my bookbag, but don't know how to open them. Could you help me? Hi Sure, can you tell me a little more about where you are in the process?  Have you tried to access the books online? So far I have clicked on my bookbag and then clicked "export files". But they are exported in formats that my computer can't open. Okay. If you give me one of the titles, I can find it and walk you through the process. css3 for web designers Is this the one by Jeff Zeldman? Yes Okay, from what I can tell, we do have access to this eBook through Safari Books Online.  Try this link here:  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-b8282-3ae346b0e6c2465f9718f4153b66de8ce23814bfbbef18b9e09973680dbc0c093 Is that the one? Yep, that's the one :) Okay, great.  So, to access this book you will need to click the Link about 2/3rds of the way down.  Unfortunately, we can only read Safari Books while online in their platform, i.e. we cannot download them.  There is a option to create a personal folder within the Safari Books Online application; you can save the book there, and then come back to it whenever you wish to read it.   Here is the link I mean:  	http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/9780134433967 When you are ready, would you like to go through any other eBooks you have selected and see how to access them?  We use a variety of eBook vendors, and, unfortunately, they are all a bit different in terms of how to access or download (where possible) their books. I looked through the css3 ebook. And I'm thinking a hardcopy will be easier to use. Thanks so much for your help though! I appreciate it! no problem, thanks!  Good luck!

Good Morning, Peter Hi- Let me read your question Above was all neatly paragraphed for clarity but now all smooshed together. Peter Sorry, but this is really beyond the scope of our chat service.   It really seems to be a question for a copyright lawyer, which we are not.  We can refer you to some copyright websites in the US if that would help. https://www.copyright.gov/title17/ Thanks Please do I was googling and your website demonstrated that CM had the expertise so I thought IÈd fire something off to you.  Our chat service is intended for our immediate community, for the more simple questions.  Complex ones we'd refer to the librarian for that subject area.  We don't however, have a copyright librarian, though we do have lawyers on campus for CMU students and faculty.  But we'll answer questions from "afar" if easy, quick.  Sadly, your question is not easy or quick! The link I gave is for the US copyright office, which then gives all US copyright law.  https://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl100.html Untangling copyright is a major task, and yes, a very, very thorny problem. https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First https://www.copyright.gov/records/voyager_tutorial.pdf I'm pretty familiar with international copyright law but as you say this is a complex issue. I've asked a couple of lawyers but they just talked around the subject in a fairly obfuscatory way. I was looking for someone who really knew their onions Checking the links you sent Thanks You're welcome.   Looks very useful. Thanks and Good bye Bye-have a good day!

I'm looking for a piece of choral music, and I'm unsure how to search the music library.   The piece is Heavenly Light by Alexander Kopylov Hello! Just a moment while I see what I can find. First, let me point you to this research guide put together by our music librarian.  This might help you find music through a number of sources:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/music  I'm going to see if I can find this in our catalog or one of the music databases.  Just a moment! kind thanks Are you looking for a score or audio recording? looking for the score Okay--just a moment. so I think I've found it on WorldCat but I can't figure out how to access it Do you have that link? oh here's the link http://www.worldcat.org/title/heavenly-light-chorus-for-mixed-voices-a-cappella/oclc/17883377?ht=edition&amp;referer=br perhaps this is interlibrary loan only? This particular version would be an interlibrary loan, as it doesn't appear we have it. It's possible that the score is accessible through a database we have access to, but it will take me some time to look into this, as music is not my expertise!   You can also contact our music librarian directly for help.  Her name is Kristen Heath and her email address is kheath@andrew.cmu.edu. This page of the research guide provides sources for scores online:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/music/scores many thanks Let us know if we can be of further assistance.  After a little more searching, it does appear that this will be interlibrary loan request.   If you need help with making that request, just let me know. thanks for all your help

ok thanks for the help  You are very welcome Here is a link to CLP's business resources http://www.carnegielibrary.org/research/?subject-id=86&audience-id=All+Ages&keyword= They have ReferenceUSA and Hoover's within a database called Mergent Intellect

Hi there, I'm working for the CIRP at CMU and I'm trying to access a book online (the pdf version I believe) on SpringerLink, which is included as a database on the library resources page.  However, when I try to open it, it says I do not have access to it.  Is there any way you could help me view it? It could be a huge help to the research.  hi Can you give me the title? It's called International Historical Statistics, by B.R. Mitchell I'm checking into our Springerlink subscription. It may be that we don't get all in the  database. If not, is there any way we could make a special request for it? We do have the Int'l historical stats in paper if that helps.  And of course we can consider an online purchase if Springerlink permits purchasing of a single title. I think that could help.  How do we get the paper version? Is it available in Hunt library? Sorry, everyone that might know about content of our springerlink contract is not answering their phones. Yes-I'll send you the call number and titles of what's in Hunt-the vols. (Europe, Americas, Asia) are in the Hunt Library reference room. Great! We'll head over and get it once we have the call number Just a second-we have several editions, and want to get the one in the library, not offsite The Americas: HA175 .M55 2007 Africa, Asia and Oceania  HA4675 .M552 2007	 europe HA1107 .M5 2007 All are in the Reference room on the 1st floor of Hunt (instead of going to the very visible cafe-bear to the right and you'll see the book shelves of the reference room) Thanks! It would still be best to get access to the PDFs eventually if possible, so let me know if any progress is made on that front. My email is mdively@andrew.cmu.edu If I find out anything I will email you. Great! Thanks again! You're welcome! As an FYI-if you are dealing with the Americas, we have the this online: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1015231 Also, the gov't has scanned older editions of the Statistical Abstract of the US-may contain some international statistics as well: http://www.census.gov/library/publications/time-series/statistical_abstracts.html

Hi I couldn't find this book  The Design of Experiments in Neuroscience did you look in our catalog? we are having problems with the catalog today let me check for you I searched it online thanks Doesn't look like we own this title.  You can borrow it by using our Interlibrary Loan services: http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting okay thank you for your help good day by the way is this a text for a class? just checking  since the prof can also put a copy on reserve in the libraries No it's required for my research in neuroscience  ok then Interlibrary Loan will be your best bet for now...I will look into ordering a copy for our collection Thank you 

Hi, I wanted to checkout a book but am not on campus right now. I will reach tomorrow. Is there a way to prebook or something? This is the book: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1480587/Holdings#tabnav Let me see if I can find it on the shelf.  We're still unpacking

do you still have the Library Arcade? Hello I am not sure. Let me see if I can locate it. Here is the old address for it: http://eps.library.cmu.edu/rooms/documents/libraries-and-collections/Libraries/etc/index.html I can't find it on the website or research guides. You might want to email engineering librarian, Donna Beck. She might have more information. http://guides.library.cmu.edu/prf.php?account_id=16977 Thank you.  I can look for it in the Internet Archive, too.  I forgot about that.  But I'll also try Donna.  Appreciate your help. You are welcome. Just found it:https://libwebspace.library.cmu.edu/libraries-and-collections/Libraries/etc/  Thank you. Did you find it on our website or the Internet Archive? Never mind. I found it from the site search using one of the game titles. 

Dear Madam, Sir,  Hello. Allow me to look into this for you. Thank you very much for your help. I am not really sure who is the best person to get in contact with. I can do a preliminary search for you.  Do you have a thesis title? Not really, I can show you the letter I found with the author's names.  Thank you Unfortunately, I am not having much luck finding a record for a thesis by these authors in our catalog OR ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. I didn't find anything neither. Do you know if there is a repository for old thesis, and in case, since when? If we have a copy of the thesis, it would be in our catalog. Let me check one more thing. No - that didn't work either. I suggest you contact the University Archives. Perhaps they could provide some direction. The archivist is Julia Corrin. http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/julia-corrin Thank you so much for your help and time, I wish you a nice day! You are welcome. Good luck!

It will give you options, and you can see who has the print, order it and it will be sent to CMU Do that while I check the second title if you would Both are only ebooks from our library .. any luck on the other title from EZ borrow? it looks like other schools offer them as ebooks only too Ok, you can also check WorldCat to see if there are print editions .. if so, you can order a copy via ILLiad (we'll need an OCLC number).  Let me check both titles .. hold plz  Ok, it look like the univ of pittsburgh has a print copy .. let me check their catalog (this is for "Analysis of Electric Machinery and Drive Systems") also Carnegie Public Library Location 	Library 	Local Holdings 	Code

Hello, I am having trouble logging in remotely, is this something you can help with? Thank you! Hello. What seems to be the problem? I am vpn'd in with cisco anyconnect to "Library Resources VPN", but when I go to log in to the library website, I get the error message "We cannot log you in at this time. Please try again later." I have entered my andrew credentials and my id/pin A couple questions. 1) When you say that you go to the library website and get the error message -- are you trying to log on to a database? Library catalog? 2) Have you tried logging out of the VPN and logging back on? 3) Have you tried not using the VPN at all? 1) I go to http://www.library.cmu.edu/  and then "My account". (I was going to try to access an e-reference book) 2) Yes, and logging into the general cmu vpn. I have also tried opening and closing my browsers, and using different browsers (chrome and firefox) 3) Yes, that was my initial attempt What is the book? The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory OK. Just a second. You should not have to log into My Account in the library catalog to view this book. If you go to the record and click on the link -- you should be able to access the book. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1502750 My Account in the library catalog is really just to place holds, save book records for later or see what you have checked out. It's confusing. 

Hello! No one answers x8-2444. Hi I have a question regarding repository.cmu.edu.  Sure-what is your question? Hi! I monitor web activity for www.sei.cmu.edu, and would like to add info about downloads of SEI reports.  These reports are added to repository.cmu.edu at intervals.  I would like to know more about the work process for adding reports to repository.cmu.edu (because I have sometimes been asked about it). Who uploads the works, and what prompts them to add SEI works. Each month, I would like to get reports showing
-	New SEI works posted in the past month
-	Institutions that have downloaded SEI work in the past month organized by sector (Commercial, Education, Govt, Military, etc)
-	Downloads by month for each SEI work (Sept 2010  present)
-	Number of SEI works posted by month (Sept 2010  present) Katie Behrman is our Research Showcase coordinator.  She can be reached at kbehrman@andrew.cmu.edu

Trouble finding a pdf for the research article: Can lifestyle changes reverse coronary heart disease? (Ornish) Hi Do you have any more info to the citation-journal title for example? Yes, "the lancet" volume 336, issue 8708, 21 July 1990, pages 129-133 Looking at our e-journals list, don't see that we get the Lancet. You'll need to do interlibrary loan for this-I'll send link for the service. http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting You'll want to use the ILLiad service-we find library that has and get copy for you.  You'll be notified when item is available.  If you've never used before you'll need to register-a quick and simple process requiring basic demographic info Thank's very much! You're welcome!

Hello, I'm trying to find articles about theories of how people learn new things. Do you have an idea of where I should start looking? Hello Have you tried any databases yet? Hi, I've tried using psychological databases, but I'm unsure of what specifically to search for. "Learning theories" seems too broad That's a good start. Let me do a quick search. Thank you! While "learning theory" is indeed broad. It looks like the phrase is used as a subject heading. You may want to start with that. And then refine your search on the results page. For instance you could limit by date or document type (like scholarly journals only). You can also limit by subject. Once you find an article that seems perfect. Look closely at the full record to see similar subjects and keywords. Clicking on this could lead to more relevant material.  Do you have a certain angle with your research? Are you focusing on task learning or a classroom setting? Do you have an age group in mind? Narrowing down your topic could also help. Okay, great! That's very helpful. I appreciate your help! You are welcome. You may also want to search ProQuest or Academic OneFile -- general databases.

Hello, I have a problem with the CMU ID card number linked to my Andrew account, which prevents me from easily logging into the Library website. Hello. Hi! Are you trying to log into your Cameo account or to use library databases? This is to log onto the library website to view checked out items, e.g. to renew them. You should be able to use your Andrew ID and pin.  Yes, when I enter my andrew ID (cdellin), it brings me to a library screen which says "cannot log you in at this time", and has fields for my CMU ID number and PIN, and the CMU ID number that is initially filled in is incorrect. If I get to this page and fix the CMU ID number to be correct, then it allows me to log in correctly. So I think that my andrew account is not linked to the correct CMU ID number somehow. What is your name? Chris Dellin, andrew id cdellin Just a second Thanks! What is the ID number you are using? My correct CMU ID number is 810171944 It seems like it's trying to use 820171257 instead, which doesn't work That is the number on your library record. But the 820 number is showing as a previous ID. So what you are saying is that the catalog is somehow overriding your correct log in? Yes, I believe 820 was a previous CMU ID that I had prior to 2012, before I rejoined as a student in 2014 When I try to log on with my andrew ID, it fails, and the form is pre-filled with the 820 number Here's an idea. Why don't you try the old login 820171257 and use 1257 as the pin. (Unless that is what is failing...) Sure Let me try that now When I try to use the 820 number with that PIN, I get the same failure message: "We cannot log you in at this time. Please try again later." Once I try the 810 number, I can log in successfully. It does allow you to type in a new number? Yes, the screen it sends me to after I enter my Andrew login looks like a library login page, with fields for "Carnegie Mellon ID" and "PIN" The fields are pre-filled with the old 820 number Here is a screenshot of the page I see after I enter my andrew login details: http://dellin.net/box/library-login-fail.png Note that it is pre-filled with the old 820 ID number At which point have you tried with your NEW 810 number? At this screen? Yes, if I enter the new 810 number here, and the new PIN, then I can log in successfully So it isn't really a problem, I can use everything, it's just annoying that I have to get my ID card out every time (-: OK. I understand. It does the same thing for me -- but my ID number works! Out of curiosity have you cleared your cache or tried a different browser?  Yes, I've tried different browsers on different computers as well. It is indeed annoying. I can ask someone how to reset that login info -- would you like me to email you? Yes, please! I appreciate it Again, it isn't urgent -- it's been like this for a while now OK. I will see what I can find out. Thank you so much! You are welcome.

Hey! I am trying to find a book to borrow but there are no results hi Where are you looking and what are you looking for? Principles of Microeconomics 6th Edition by Robert Frank (Author), Ben Bernanke (Author), Kate Antonovics (Author), Ori Heffetz (Author) ISBN-13: 978-0073517858 ok-let me check for you. thank you1 ! I see we have the 5th ed, we don't have the 6th and the 5th ed. is checked out.http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1480261 You can put a hold on it,but it looks like someone has a hold on it already, so you'll be 2nd in line. This is really not going to work if the book is one that' that's required for the entire semester. Hmm thank you...Is there anyway to possibly get it through interlibrary loan system You could try interlibrary loan or EZ Borrow.  I'll send you the link that covers both. Again, having these for the whole semester via ILL/EZ Borrow...that will be tough.  Maybe this will help, too: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/textbooks Here's the link for ILL and EZ Borrow: http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting Okay thank you! Do you possibly have the books on reserve in the meantime while I get them Here's the link for reserve material-you need to search by prof's name or course # http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/reserves And then there's always buying the book ;-) Haha I guess its not that expensive when you compare it to the tuition cost Thanks again Just joshing-have no idea how much it costs!  glad to help out-good luck! :-)

If I were looking to perform market research on the nuclear power industry, which research database or databases would you recommend? Hi Let me get you the guide for market research-it will list the dbs perfect.  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/marketresearch Thank you much. You're welcome!

Hi Hi I am looking for this article and I cannot find it anywhere, so I am wondering if we have a hard copy of it in the library the article is: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264244450_Promoting_Self-Reflection_of_Social_Isolation_Through_Persuasive_Mobile_Technologies_The_Case_of_Mother_Caregivers_of_Children_With_Cancer Sure-be glad to check-just a few minutes its in the äINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION 30(10) thanks  No, sorry, we don't have it in paper.  Most recent we would have is 18 months ago (embargoed in the Business Source Premier database).  Would you like me to check if Pitt has it? yes that would be great Sure-just a minute Sorry, their most recent is 18 months ago as well. Interlibrary Loan would be your best bet.  Are you familiar with that service? No I am not You register with the service (easy and quick-basic demographic info), then fill out the form for the item you want (in this case, journal article).  We find a library that has it and get a copy for you.  Often with journal articles we'll get a PDF, put the copy in your ILLiad account (that's your ILL account you registered for) and then you can read and/or download to your own computer.  You'll also be able to keep a record of all your requests.  We can get just about anything as long as someone will lend/copy for us!  I'll send link next http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting ok thanks! how long does it usually take? Usually about 5-7 days, though if there's not a big pile (your request goes on bottom of pile), it can be quicker.  Once I got an article the next day! ok great thank you You're welcome!  Anything else I can help you with? no, not at this moment- thanks! You're welcome-have a good day! :-)

Hello There,  I am Diana Cugliari I will be a TA in Heinz College Public Policy and Management.  I have been provided a CMU email, and I have been asked to do some research for the Prof. Jordan.  How do I login into the library system, specifically to access the Hoovers database? hi if you are on campus, all you have to do is go to the library homepage and click on Research Databases, then H, then find Hoovers you should be automatically logged in I am offsite. If you are off campus, however, you will be asked to use your Andrew ID and password to log in (this is also the case if you are using a laptop) So I need to my CMU ID to login? not your CMU ID .. your Andrew ID the user id part of your email ..  for example: jsmith from jsmith@andrew.cmu.edu then you enter your password yes, yes... that is dcugliar got that. But it is asking for a PIN.   Does that come from an ID? oh, that's the last 4 digits of the SECOND set of numbers on your ID but weird that it's asking that.  Are you sure you're not trying to access your library account? Maybe... Would you send me the link on where I should be? ok, hold on you should be here http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?a=h Ok. Do we have access to iBiz World? let me check yes I am trying to learn what resources we have able and can access.

I am an computer science and engineering student. I'm looking for some good books on Computer Organization and Architecture  Hi There are a few databases that we have that would be a great starting place for books related to computer science/architecture. Ok They are:  Safari Books Online, SpringerLink, and Wiley Books Online (in that order).  I would be happy to send you the links.  You can also find these databases by going to the main library page, selecting "research databases", and then navigating to each of these databases. These are my "go to" places for good sci/tech books.  You can also search directly from our main catalog - here is the link:  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Advanced You might also find some books here that are not in one of these three databases. I've gone through the book Computer System Architecture by David Patterson. But I'm facing some problems in the digital part of that book. Can I directly contact to the subject librarian? Yes, there are several of us who are liaisons to SCS, but we do not have one specific person (we are currently looking for one).  If you send an email to sciref@andrew.cmu.edu one of us will answer your question.  Regarding the problems you mentioned, please provide as much specfics as possible so that we can be of most assistance.   OK. Thanks a lot for helping  my pleasure

Good Morning! Do you have electronic files of students' theses available? Particularly undergraduate honors theses? Hi! We do have a database that will potentially provide access to dissertations and theses. Let me get you the link Thank you! Here they are. They are called Dissertations and Theses by Proquest. The first link includes institutions across the globe. The second one is CMU-specific: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?q=dissertations%20and%20theses Now, there is no guarantee that the full text will be there for each and every dissertation or theses. But you will be able to get the citation information for many In addition to this, CMU-specific ones may show up in our catalog or Research Showcase (our institutional repository) if they were submitted that way. thank you! the link doesn't include undergraduate honors theses, but i appreciate your help! Here is the link to Research Showcase: http://library.cmu.edu/find/unique/researchshowcase/search we'll check with the dietrich dean's office Sounds good. Research Showcase may contain some as well :)_ :)  great! thanks so much and have a great day! You do the same! Thanks for reaching out to us :)

Research databases-many of them are in Proquest, and you can search many all at once.  go to Research Databases-it's on the front page under the Search bar. I see Then go to P for proquest.   Once in proquest, a mega db of 28 other dbs, you can go to the top where it says Database oh, awesome thanks again! I've used proquest before Then you can deselect all, the re-select the ones you want, like Pollution Abstracts, Environmental Sciences and Pollution Management_  I didn't know CMU had access You're welcome, and thanks again for reporting the error message, CMU has over 500 dbs-this is what you're searching in Articles.  That's alot of databases!! this is extremely helpful This way you can get more relevant hits Always happy to help! :-)

Hi! hi Could you please resend the HBR cases available in library? I would be grateful Apologies for inconvenience You're chatting with a different librarian.  Let me check and see what was sent before oh! Okay I just wanted to know what all harvard business review articles are available in library? Any electronic subscription which we can access for free, being CMU students? This is what he sent, but cases are not in the HBR. You might find an article that covers a case, but they won't be the cases  Harvard business review (0017-8012) from 10/01/1922 to present in Business Source Premier from 01/01/1997 to 05/31/2000 in Academic OneFile and General OneFile from 11/01/2015 to present in ProQuest Telecommunications
12:37 ethanp@libraryh3lp.com you can go to e-journals on our website and search for the title Harvard Business Review then click on the years in which you are interested.
12:37 ethanp@libraryh3lp.com however, I don't know if they cover all cases in the journal. Also what is the procedure to access those articles? It's already been sent: you can go to e-journals on our website and search for the title Harvard Business Review then click on the years in which you are interested. And do we have physical copies of HbR available in library which we can have access to for free? e-journals link can be found under Search and Find on the Libraries' homepage. Yes, we have paper copies. You can search our library catalog to see if we have a journal in paper.  Here's the link to the HBR catalog record: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/441027

Hello, I'm a student trying to do research on humorous political protest. Especially how cultural and occasional backgrounds can influence the efficacy of the protest. Do you have any suggestion for me on which database to look for resources? Hi! May I ask which class this is for and what department you are in? This is the interpretation &amp; argument class from the English Department.  I'm in the business department myself Ah okay. Thanks for that information.  Let me do some checking and in the meantime, I can direct you to our English Liaison who works very closely with this assignment and this class His name is Ethan Pullman and his contact info can be found here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/ethan-pullman I'm going to check and see if he has a research guide devoted to this class that will help with specific databases Okay, I believe that this is the research guide that Ethan has put together for this class: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/interpretation On the "Political Resistance" tab in the guide, there are links to some resources: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/interpretation In addition to Academic OneFile, JSTOR, CQ Press Databases, and Project Muse, consider using Ethnic NewsWatch, PAIS Index, and Policy File Index since it sounds like your topic is more political/political science related It might be worth talking with Ethan a bit more to figure out some great resources and to talk about your topic as well.

hi there - i am getting 'no results' for an article, "interdisciplinary research as a form of research," published in the Journal of the Society of Research Administrators, V13, Fall 1981. I used advanced search, but I never know whether 'no results' means 'we don't have it,' or 'you don't know how to search for things.' Can you help? Thanks. Hi. Let me try to search by just the journal name in our list of e-journals and then in the catalog.  One moment. thanks So far, our access to the online version of the journal doesn't go back quite that far in time.  Let me check for print in the catalog. OK We seem to only have it back to 1983 in print, so Interlibrary Loan might be your best bet.  If time is of the essence, we could check at Pitt for it (and hope it's not in storage). OK, thanks. Time is of the essence (of course) and, also, I am traveling so only a scanned version would be useful. That sounds kind of improbable, but if you would like to check, that would be wonderful.  And actually, if they do have it, I would love a copy of the whole issue, not just that one article ... (she said, shooting for the moon) One moment. From what I can see, Pitt has it on microform in the Hillman Library. How might I be able to get a copy of it?  You would have to visit in person.  Hopefully the Hillman Library would have the machines necessary to read/print the microformat. Or, Interlibrary Loan might be best. How should I go about doing that? I have a couple of books from them, but I don't know that I've requested something in microformat. You would have to visit Pitt's Hillman Library in person.  If you use Interlibrary Loan, you would likely receive the article via email. I'd like to do the Interlibrary Loan. Do I do that through you, or can I do it myself?  You can do that yourself.  I'll send you the link to sign up for a free account - and the vast number of ILLs are no cost to you. That's great, thanks. Perfect.  The system you want to use for this request is ILLiad (on the left):  http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting OK, thanks so much for your help!  Wish me luck.  It will be a great service for you.  Anything else?

Hi Do you have this book at CMu http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-a12104-8b0b48c949ad26db08df96e123e306d0a43e5ea7e93e90445b5fe7d3a8efef432 hi The link you pasted does not work-can you give me the title of the item you want? This is the ISBN 0750647906
9780750647908 I got this from CMU site Can you please give me the title? sure the new metallurgy of cast metals castings second edition Thank you-just a minute No, we don't have that book in the library.  If you did a "search everything" search, then you may have found an article/book review of it.  "Search everything" searches more than our catalog-it searches databases where we may or may not have the item. is there a way I can get this item? Sure-for books you can use either EZ borrow (you search catalogs, you place request, comes in in 3-5 days) or Interlibrary Loan (we search catalogs, place request, come in in 5-7 days).  I'll send you the link in my next. http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting Thanks! You're welcome! \

I am doing some genealogy research and think I have identified a lead in a CM yearbook.  I just need two or three pages copied.  Do you have  a service for that? Hello. You should contact the University Archives. http://www.library.cmu.edu/find/unique/archives

Hello hi I know that there's an order for the book "Handbook of Media Economics" The e-text version is already available, but the hardcover version seems to be on the way Can you update me on this? It is still on order and hasn't been received yet. Is sthis Rolando? We're looking into it right now. hello Yes, Rolando Hi Rolando, we're checking into this.  It was just sent from the publisher.  oh ok, great Sue? yes! Hey!!! Great no problem-surprised it is taking so long.  thought everyone preferred e-books anyway :-) So you put the book kind of "on hold" for me? Yeah, the e-book is nice, but I cannot print it or download it in PDF Your name and email is in the records already with a hold-we just need the book so we can send to cataloging, and then it will go to circulation. It's kind of slow changing pages and things like that You should be able to do some printing...let me check (and I was teasing about e-book-I prefere print myself! :-)) hehe It seems that I can only print on a page by page basis... or maybe I'm just dumb, I don't know hehe You can print, but only one page at a time-yes, most e-books are like that so you don't print the whole book off and have...a paper book!! No, you're not dumb. Publishers just dont' want people to download or print the entire book. Yeah, although there are some books I can download it whole but yes Well, it depends on publisher, date of book, a lot of things. By the way... I'm having a phone call today with someone from SNL Kagan Oh!  The EPP budget you can use for books, is only for books? Yes, usually, and a lot of it is spend already. Of course I'll play the "poor grad student card" first... yes-do that (play poor grad student), but keep me informed of what they say. ok what exactly are you working on again (I know it's media, but what specifically)? let me copy what I wrote to this guy from SNL In fact, he contacted me That sounds great. - OTA TV Ratings
- MVPD Ratings
- Retransmission Consent Payments and Must Carry
- Over the Top providers
- Advertising revenues, Cost per Thousand
- Big-4 Network Affiliation, other networks, diginets
- Set top boxes and other customer premise equipment Good news-while we were chatting, I was having someone check the mailroom and the books just came in today.   Niceee They will go to (rush) cataloguing so you might get them...not sure if tomorrow-depends who is in, but definitely by early next week. You'll get an email when they are ready for you to pick up. great About what I'm doing, I'm working on the economic and policy implications of the new digital tv standard that will be available in a couple of years New Over the Air transmission standard Thank you-that's what I wanted to know. That's ultra high definition TV? So the list of issues I gave you, is basically what I could potentially need Yes, that's one thing about this new standard I understand.  Really industry specific stuff.  Yes Nielsen, SNL Kagan, Kantar Media stuff  yeah....non of which we have Well, I'll let you know how it goes with SNL Thanks again for the book! Yes, do let me know.  You're welcome re the book! Enjoy!

Hello! How long typically does it take for an item to arrive from off-site storage? I requested an item on April 18, and my library record doesn't provide any update about the progress of this request.  Hi Let me see if I can track that down... Could you provide the name of the title that you requested? Structural functions in music. by Wallace Berry. Okay, please stand by a moment while I track it down Which circulation desk did you request it be sent to? I selected Hunt Library.  Thanks.  I'm on the phone now with the offsite storage.  Just a few more moments please. Okay.  The book is neither at the offsite storage facility or at Hunt Library.  Ona Taylor (x86975) is investigating now to find out its location.  If you have any further questions, you may contact her directly.  She will also get in touch with you once she uncovers additional information. Thank you for looking into it.  My pleasure.  Sorry it is missing - hopefully we can get it to you very shortly. thanks!

Hi! Hi! My name is Jaya, first year MBA student How can I help? Hi Jaya Could you share me resources I can use for company research ? Yes I can Let me introduce myself. I am Ryan Splenda, the Business & Economics Librarian Good to meet you Hi Ryan, Nice to meet you. :) :) Okay, I have created a research guide devoted to company research Let me give you the link Here it is: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/companies Thanks a lot. That would be great! You are welcome! There are many different resources that we have for company research i am unable to access MarketLine can you tell me what you are looking for? I can give you an idea of where to look I am looking for company Veritas portfolio  Okay I am having the same problem with MarketLine I will report this to our e-resources team to see what the problem is In the meantime let me see what we can do for the company Veritas Yes please Is it Veritas Technologies in Mountain View, CA? yes Okay, thanks. This seems to be a private company, so finding information on them will be a bit more challenging Yes Thats why i was hoping is we have any tool for that if* We do have a resource that specializes in private companies (PrivCo). However, it looks like they are not profiled in their database I am checking some others as we speak ok It looks like they became a private company in 2016 after splitting with Symantec in 2015.  I can't seem to locate a profile of the company though Still checking Yes that is what i read as well :) Haha, at least we are on the same page!! Okay, I was able to find a brief company profile report in the Mergent Online database Looks like Veritas Technologies is a subsidiary of Veritas US Inc. Let me see if I can find anything on them Let me show you how I got to the report in Mergent Online Do you have time? yes Please go ahead  Great! Are you on that research guide that I gave the link for? yes Okay, there should be a box on the right hand side called "Company Financials" Mergent is the first database listed in that box let me know once you are connected got it Great. Now there should be a checkbox that is unchecked called "D&B Private Company Database" Go ahead and check that box, then search for Veritas Technologies in the search box below it Thank you Ryan. Just one more question. When was the dat updated? Any idea on that? No problem! When you say date, do you mean on that profile report within Mergent Online? yes They usually update their records pretty frequently, but the exact date I'm not sure of.  It is definitely within the last half year (or should be) I can check one more place for a report okay hopefully 2016 Definitely should be the case for that that would be great A few other suggestions. Since this company seems to be a bit more difficult, Consider using the Business Source Premier database to try and find pieces of news related to the company. There may be helpful articles that you can piece together to form a better picture Business Source Premier has a lot of trade journal information (very niche industry publications) that may contain additional information on Veritas Business Source Premier is located in the News and Research Articles box on the left-hand side of the guide okay i will look into it. Thanks Ryan. No problem. Always happy to help.  I tried one more resource but it didn't have anything Just as a backup, Hoover's database has a profile on them as well. It is very thin though Finally, feel free to contact me in the future if you have have more questions. My email is rsplenda@andrew.cmu.edu I also have consultation hours over at Tepper every Tuesday from 2-4PM near the Cooper Auditorium Thats great. Good to know. If I need any help I would reach out to you. Thanks for all the help. Have a nice day Ryan. You are welcome. Thanks for contacting us, Jaya. Have a wonderful day! :)

Hello! I was wondering if I could find the full document to this URL: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-proquest_miscellaneous_17278579383 Hello!  So sorry for the delay. Just a moment while I check on that. I'm afraid we don't have access to this article.  However, you may be able to request it via Interlibrary Loan. Have you used our ILL service before?

Do you have this book? QA402.3 .S45 2008	 Hello! Just a moment while I search our catalog. Is this the book you're looking for?  http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1490492 Yes do you have it here? Unfortunately, it appears our only holding is on the Qatar campus.

Hello, I am seeking information about Dorothy Parker hi what type of information? I need information about her life and books Ok, are you a student, staff, or faculty at Carnegie Mellon?  What databases have you tried? I am a student but I am not familiar with the databases.  Not a problem ..  Go to library.cmu.edu and find Research Databases link (under search box) there you can click on "L" and find the link for the Literature Resource Center If you're off campus, you'll be asked to log in with your andrew ID and password you can search LRC by person (Dorothy Parker) and you should get tabs that cover various information, bio, works, etc. Perfect! Thank you so much for your help! You're welcome .. anything else? No that's all. Thanks again. great .. have a nice day

Good afternoon, Do you have available Nippon Steel Technical Report No. 10 that was published in 1973? Hello. Let me look into this for you. thanks I am not having much luck finding it. But give me a couple more minutes. You may want to contact one of our engineering librarians. If we do not have it, they can help you obtain it elsewhere. any luck? Actually -- I think I found it. oh cool no. 10? Just a second. sure Let me go check the shelf to confirm that it's what you want. ok thanks Are you sure the year is 1973? The Nippon Steel Tech Report No. 10 that I found is 1977. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1015678 Do you have a title for the report? hmm i have title of article within report which is where reference originally comes from whatever you have would be helpful. "Production of titanium ingots in a vacuum plasma furnace, introduction to vacuum plasma furnace" Nippon Stainless Technical Report, No. 10, pp 65-81, 1973 Nagai, Murase, Suzuki, Kishima are the 4 authors of that  So Nippon Steel Technical Report and Nippon Stainless Technical Report are two different things right? That might be the problem. I was looking at Nippon Steel based on your original question. Gotcha - i searched another database and the earlier versions of the report i believe were called Nippon Steel... rather than Nippon Stainless... does anything come up if you search Nippon Stainless Technical Report? Not yet. I am looking though. Great thanks! Which database were you searching? http://www.ntis.gov/ Library of Congress steered me there as well... I am really not having much luck. Would you like the contact information for the engineering librarian? http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/donna-beck ok i'll try them thank you for your help! You are welcome. I am sorry I couldn't help.

Hello, May I get some help on finding time line of major business or tech events from google and corresponding stock rise and fall? Hi Thank you! This is my final project for a business course, but I'm an engineering student with almost zero background in this area  Thanks for contacting us No problem at all. I am the Business Librarian and can help Probably the best way to go about this is from a company resources perspective Let me introduce you to a guide that I have created on company research: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/companies Great! I searched for such information on Google and something like this would be great, but all the time lines I found a pretty old and only goes until 2011 No problem. You will probably have to piece together a couple of different resources in order to complete your timeline I don't think that we have one resource that will cover both in one swoop On that guide, take a look at the "Company Financials" box There is a resource listed there called Mergent Online select that resource This looks great, the info here is pretty up to date Once in it type in Alphabet in the search box (because they recently restructured and that is the name of the ultimate parent company now) Oh great! You got in and found Google/Alphabet? Click on the "Equity Pricing" tab and you can get to current and historical stock pricing data Yes You can even export this data into excel using the "Report" sub tab Is there a place that I can find major events? I wish to see the link between the stock change and Google's events, such as the Cloud Next conference last week and the release of Google phone pixel several months ago Okay. The same database has a "News" tab as well, but it may not go back as far as you'd like it too. Yes, I wish to see some major events maybe range for the whole year of Google There is a sub-section within that tab called historical news that gives you some more info Also on the main "Company Details" tab again, there is a section down at the bottom of that page that gives "Company News and Corporate Events" There is a second database to consider for news as well though The historial news is about acquisitions, would there be some resource for major business events, product release, change in market structure and major players? We may have to go the news database route for this. Take a look at the "News Sources and Research Articles" box within the guide and click on the Business Source Premier databae We can search this database for Google/Alphabet  as a "Company Entity" and then narrow by publication types after that This is just another potential place to find news because this database has access to newspapers, magazines, and trade publications all from the business discipline Is there a tab for "Company Entity"? There is a drop down search filter for company entity next to the search box itself. It defaults to "Select Field Optional" but can be changed You could also change that drop down to "Ticker Symbol" as well if you'd like It looke like company entity is more reliable though looks* If you do go the ticker route, use their old ticker GOOG instead of the new one GOOGL Thank you very much! No problem! One last suggestion if you'd like Actually, before that...notice that there are additional limiters on the left-hand side of the page within Business Source Premier that you can use to further narrow your search results. For example, Date range, publication type (news vs. trade publication, etc.) Is trade publication mainly focusing on the finance? It depends, it could focus on quite a few different aspects  They mainly focus on the different industry(ies) that your company of interest operates within But this would be where you could get some nitty gritty info on major events that have happened with Google Thank you! Have a nice afternoon!

i would like to find research aricles on G20 or/and APEC Hi! Search results is almost zero Okay, I can help you with this What are you studying out of curiosity? If you are looking at this from the economics perspective, we have created a research guide on Economics Research: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/econres Within this guide, there is a section/box called Economic Literature - Databases From there, there is a resource called EconLit doing a quick search within EconLit for "APEC" yields about 400 articles A search for "G20 yields about 3,300. There are ways to limit results too thanks, that is helpful Article:

Hello, I'm trying to use the Library resources to research companies  I was wondering if there's a database for startups  Hi! like Crunchbase or something similar that the library subscribes to  Yes, we have some resources that could be helpful when trying to find information on startups Let me direct you to a guide that I've created on company research http://guides.library.cmu.edu/companies Within this guide there are a couple of database to consider. Since you are focusing on startups, the best resource to use is probably PrivCo. It is listed int he "Company Basics" box It does require an account set up using your CMU credentials, but this is one of the premier resources that we have for private companies (since most, if not all, startups are private). There are some other databases in this guide that may have very basic information on private/startup companies as well. They are Hoover's, ReferenceUSA, and to some degree Mergent Online Are you mainly looking for basic information on startups? I also forgot to mention that downloading/exporting in PrivCo is allowed, but there is a monthly limit. It does reset each month. I believe it is 25 company downloads and 50 transaction downloads per month By the way, my name is Ryan Splenda and I am the Business & Economics Librarian and liaison to Tepper.  Are you still there? sorry, i lost you in my tabs and this is helpful information  thanks for your help  I'm glad that this is helpful! Is there anything in particular that you are looking for with regards to startups? yes actually  well, it's not specifically for startups  Okay, sounds good i'm looking for product management positions (or as least in the PM orbit) at small to medium sized companies  Ahh okay. Are you looking for position openings or for contacts with that title? both, i suppose  If it is for position openings, unfortunately, we don't have any resources that have that type of job announcement information But, there is a way to screen for executives within companies in a couple of our resources the two best resources that have a "Build a List" function are Hoover's and ReferenceUSA There is a way to screen for executives using specific criteria (ex. by geography or by industry) Are you, by chance, from Tepper? no, i'm a psychology alumni  Ah I see. Are you a current CMU affiliate? I spoke with steve rakas last week  and he suggested I look through library resources  I'm glad that he recommended us :) I haven't had success with the career office, so I'm working through the other / Library resources  yeah, i've had great experiences with the library  Sounds good :) you people will pimp out research papers :) Are you still a current member of the CMU community though? Hahaha The only reason I'm asking that is because once you graduate or aren't a current affiliate in some way anymore, you won't be able to access these resources.  The only way to get to them would be by physically coming to Hunt Library and signing up for a guest pass and using them on our computer terminals It's CMU's rules unfortunately. ok, i can't be put on the VPN?  Unfortunately, no. Once your CMU account is deactivated, the library privileges go as well There is the possibility of accessing business resources electronically from the public library of Pittsburgh (CLP) If you sign up for a card with them, you'll be able to access some of the same resources remotely

hello I would like to know if you have received my interlibrary loan request since I did not hear anything back. I requested to pick up at the Mellon library. My name is Marcela Madrid. thanks Hi We can't answer that question since we don't have access to the interlibrary loan records.  You can go into your ILLiad account (where you filled out request) and you can see the status of your request.  If you still have questions, contacts for additional information can be found on the ILL page http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting thanks.  You're welcome

Hi, how are you? Hello My professor discussed with us that there was a course website that the library set up and I was wondering how to get to it It's not a course reserve, I don't think Is it a research guide for your course? I'm not entirely sure What is the coarse? It's for the course 79-384 Garbage Gone Global Think this is it? http://guides.library.cmu.edu/garbage Yes, it is! Can I ask how you navigated to the page? Sure. On the library homepage there is a link to Research Guides under Quick Links. Then I searched By Course. Oh okay, perfect! Thank you so much for your help! You are welcome.

hello hi i am on the ieee website, Is it possible to sign in with my Andrew id to download a paper? Hi.  The best thing to do is to go into the library's web site.  Use the "Research Databases" link and choose IEEE Xplore from the alphabetical listing of databases. I'll send you the databases link... http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php If you're off campus, it will prompt you for your andrew id & password.   It may do the same if you're on wireless.

Hi, is this Hunt Library? Hi I am actually in Sorrells, there is no one online right now from Hunt.  May I be of assistance? Yes! I was wondering if as a CMU student, I have access to LexisNexis for free? Yes, you can access the LexisNexis for free.  Just go to the Library web page, then Research Databases, and then nav. to LexisNexis Got it! Thank you so much my pleasure

Hi Hi I am looking for a book but having a hard time finding it Ok-what information do you have? title/author? Title is: comparative issues in the governance of research biobanks Are you there? I'm here-thought you left! We don't have it.  Pitt does, but Is there anyway to get it from Pitt? but it's an e-book.  You'd need to go down there, get a guest id  and read online Or, what you could do is interlibrary loan Fill out a form, we'll find a copy for you and borrow it for you ok, just have two quetsions Sure- How long would it take if I fill out the form today? and As a postdoctoral fellow, how long would I be able to keep the book? probably a few days to a week. All depends on workload at both libraries, if book is avialable, etc.  Also, if they have paper copy. I think loan period varies by library, but usually at least 3 weeks, and you usually can renew. Great. Now would you be able to help in filling the form? I am new and not familiar with CMU system Sure-it's easy.  You'll need to register if you've never done ILL before-you'll want to use the ILLiad system-I'll send you the link http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting oh-actually for a book, use EZ Borrow.  You'll do the searching in a joint library catalog, find an available copy and place the request yourself.  Faster than ILL since you do the searching, placing the request. Takes 3-5 fdays Here's all the publication info if you do decide to do ILL: Title:	Comparative issues in the governance of research biobanks : property, privacy, intellectual property, and the role of technology / Giovanni Pascuzzi, Umberto Izzo, Matteo Macilotti, editors.
Publisher:	Berlin ; Heidelberg : Springer, [2013] The EZ system says: authentication failed It doesn't let me login You're a CMU person?  What did you login with? it asks for Patron ID, so I entered 9 digit id on my CMU card Ok, that should have done it.  I just did mine and got in fine. Try again-maybe a typo? I tried 3 times. nope, doesnt work oh....you may have to talk to someone at Circ about that. Let me check and see if the title is in there anyway-just a sec thank you You'll need to do ILL anyway-the titles in EZ Borrow are all e-books and one can't lend/borrow e-books. I see So the ILL system is free, right? yes! Great. I will fill out the form now. Awesome!  You'll be notified when it is available. Alright, rquested it online. Thank you so much for your help :-) You're very welcome! have a great day! :-) You have a wonderful weekend Thx! I plan to!

Hi there, good morning how may I help you? I'm doing research on gift giving to couples and was wondering if you could point me towards something along the lines of an industry report that will tell me what % of all gifts go to couples? I see .. let me refer you to our business librarian for this question.  Please hold. Ok thanks! Hello Okay so you are looking for some statistics on gift giving and couples HI there Yes that is correct. What I have found so far are some statistics on the overall $ money spent on things like wedding registries every year, however I would also like to find both a) what % of people have actually given a gift to a couple before; and b) what % of all gifts go to couples (as opposed to a single person) Okay, I'm not sure that an actual industry report is out there for this particular statistic Okay so this is only within the wedding realm you are looking for? No, not only within wedding realm. So we can look at the entire gift-giving realm then That was just the only relevant stat I could find so far Yes that is correct Okay, this is going to take some digging on my part. It won't be easy to find and we may not have a report dedicated to these kind of statistics. What I can suggest as a start is to look at a resource that focuses on nothing but statistics. It is called Statista and can be found here:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=statista Ok great. I will take a look at it.  Can you give me your contact information so that I can get back to you on what I find? Sure: jgivi@andrew.cmu.edu. I really don't want you to spend a lot of time on this if you don't think it will turn up anything, so if nothing seems to be out there, no need to dig too deep! I was able to find this summary or a larger Gifting Market report by a company called Unity Marketing. It may not have the exact figures you are looking for, but does give an overview of the market as a whole. I'm attaching it now No worries! I have no problem looking into this a little bit.  Unfortunately, we won't be able to get that entire report from Unity Marketing because we don't subscribe to their product. I can give you a couple of other resources to check as well Thanks for the contact info! Ok great. &amp; Thank you! :) My name is Ryan by the way...pleasure to meet you virtually Another resource that may turn up some stats on this is called Passport: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=passport They focus on a lot of consumer product market research. There may be an article/report of relevance Sorry, I was checking out that report! Super intersting. interesting** I'm Julian, nice to meet you as well! Thanks for the second resource as well. No problem! I'm going to check in a couple more...do you have time to hang around for a few minutes? Yes definitely. Thanks! Great! Here's another quick summary of the "e-Gifting market" as well. May contain some useful info:  Still looking around in some other resources. Thanks for your patience No problem, thank you! These are all really cool reports. Good deal! Glad they are helpful. Okay, I was able to find one very large report that we subscribe to that has a short chapter devoted to gift giving. It looks like there are some useful statistics within it as well...especially some wedding-specific content The problem is that we can't download just that short chapter...have to download the whole thing. I can try and send it over this chat mechanism and we can see if it works If that attachment did work, the Gift Giving section begins on pg. 205 That works. Wow. I'm amazed that the industry puts all these together. Great! So much information! Yeah we have some pretty decent resources. The problem with this industry is that it isn't as cut and dry as some of the others...so finding some of those particular statistics become difficult Hopefully, these have helped a little. I do have to run at the moment because I have another appointment coming up at 9:30 Ok thank you so much for all the help! I can continue to do a little digging if you'd like? No problem at all! My pleasure :)( If you have some free time, I would absolutely appreciate it. If not, the information you gave me thus far is great! Either way, have a nice day, Ryan! Okay, sounds good. You have a wonderful day too, Julian! Pleasure meeting you again What is the time frame on your research out of curiosity? Indefinite. I'm a doctoral student and this is just one of a many ongoing projects I am working on (and it is in the very early stages)! Okay great! Sounds good. Again, have a wonderful day :) you too!

Hi. I'm looking for a digital copy of this book: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1044842, but the link seems broken. Is there any possibility that you can help me with this? hi Can you give me the title of the book? Art as experience by John Dewey Thx-let me look into this. sure  At one time some of this book must have been put on reserve, and the link would take you to that portion of the scanned book (it wouldn't have been the whole book).  It's since been removed, but for some reason the link is still in the record.  So we have several copies of the print book, but we do not have this electronically. I see. I guess I would get a print copy then. Thanks for looking it up for me:) You're welcome.  I can look for a digital copy if you want, but doubt it would be available for the entire book. How much of a book would it usually be? http://thenewschoolhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dewey-ArtasExperience.pdf oh. kk. thanks! http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic532256.files/Dewey_ArtAsExperience.pdf Sees like there are lots of "parts" out there.  Search "art as experience" dewey pdf gotcha thanks! You're welcome.   Again, probably won't find the whole book, but maybe enough for your needs? Glad to help-have a good day! You too :) :-)

I'm a new adjunct for this fall. hi with which college/school/department are you affiliated? the History department Ok, what's is your question regarding access?

Hello, I am trying to log in but I am getting the message: Sorry, we are unable to automatically log you in. when I enter the numbers in my CMU id, it doesn't work hi there what are you trying to log into?  https://search.library.cmu.edu/ actually, you don't need to log in to use the library website - your account is just to see what you might have checked out, or to renew items Are you by chance a new student? (Sometimes it takes a few days to register your ID number with the library.) I am a Disney Research employee, we are given CMU ids and apparently we should have access to the library I am not able to check out a book because it keep sending me to the log in page So I'm guessing that you are not on campus and trying to check out an e-book? I am on campus, at least I'm in the CMU networks this is the book: Fairness in children : a social-cognitive approach to the study of moral development  I don't think it is an ebook That's just what I was going to ask - let me check - OK - that book - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/174509 - is a print book but it's being held offsite, so it needs to be requested.  how long would that take? If you look at the record, you'll see where it says "place a hold" - and you would do it there - it takes 24 hours I'm still wondering if we have answered your question about  "I am not able to check out a book because it keep sending me to the log in page" Is there something else I can help with? when I click that it sends me to the log in page again so I cannot "place a hold" Sorry - was interrupted -  it should be sending you to the authentication page where it asks for your Andrew username and ID? is it not accepting your username and pw? it sends m to a page asking my Carnegie Mellon ID and PIN: not my andrew id Does the page look like the one I sent above? (where it says:  file shared" but when I enter the numbers on my card, it says "Sorry, we are unable to automatically log you in.
Please enter the CMU ID number and PIN from your ID card and try again:" it does not am I on the right address? I'm wondering whether it would be easier to straighten this out on the phone?  You could call me at 412-965-1011 - sure ready when you are

I need a hard copy of conference proceedings from 1991 and I can't find it listed anywhere. I found the first annual symposium from 1981 here http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-crossref_primary_10_1109_C_M_1981_2206173 I need the 11th annual symposium proceedings Hi actually a digital copy of the proceedings is fine too Okay, please give me a few moments and I will try to find it.  If we get disconnected for any reason, my name is Ole and my email is ovillads@andrew.cmu.edu.   okay if it helps I found a listing for the 5th annual proceedings at princeton.edu and one for the 7th annual proceedings at a tokyo library but have no luck looking for the 11th annual proceedings okay, thanks Still looking.  Trying to hone in on the 11th symposium - havn't found it yet but am still looking okay thanks Still looking.  Can't seem to get the 11th in any searches.  Want to check a couple more places. go ahead and take your time I've got chat window up on my computer, but i'm also working on other stuff so no rush great, thanks Hi, unfortunately I can't seem to find it - at least not the 11th annual symposium in 1991.  Best bet will be to submit an Inter-Library Loan (ILLiad) request; they have additional resources to help find hard to get items.  Have you used ILLiad before?  If not, I can provide you some instructions. yes i have used illiad before.  but its been a while can you hang on while i enter the request just in case i have any questions of course okay looks good.  thanks

Hi, I am doing some research and I found a link which requires access to ProQuest in order to read the article. Does CMU have access to this site, and would I be able to access it off campus? Hi, yes, the Libraries subscribes to Proquest.  Go to the Libraries' homepage www.library.cmu.edu and click on Research Databases (under the search box, also listed Under Search and Find). Click P for proquest.  If you're off campus you'll be prompted for your Andrew user ID and psswd.

One moment please Okay, this is a book and it looks like we don't have it unfortunately. However, the University of Pittsburgh has it at one of their libraries. I believe they allow CMU affiliates to check out their materials okay awesome I'll look into that thank you! No problem.

Hey I am a CMU graduate student and I cannot find an availible copy of the paper 'An autoradiographic study of the organization of intrahippocampal association pathways in the rat¾'  hi I got to the lib web page 'http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-c830-ac124539e60b0e63502d1353d39bc17555538d4d3e0373fab800b00ca53d804d2' but it does not work once I clicked 'Get it @ CMU' thank you for looking into this! By the way, I am at school and on campus network now Let me check a few things. Thanks! We don't have this journal back that far (1978), so you'll need to do interlibrary loan.  Fill out a form, we'll find a library that has it and get you a copy. You'll want to use ILLiad on this page http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting If you've never done ILL before, you'll need to register, a quick and easy process (basic demographic info) thanks for the information! You're welcome!

Hi there, I am trying to track down a journal article but am having trouble doing so HI the  title is:

Page:
	
904 - 916 Okay, it looks like we only have access to this journal through 2009.  In this case, you will need to use our interlibrary loan (ILL) services  yea i saw a message to that effect, i was hoping there might be a "work-around" Have you done that before? Unfortunately, that is the only way we would be able to get it it's been many years!  I'm a CMU alum (2007) who started working for the university about a year and a half ago Welcome back! thank you! I can show you how to access our interlibrary loan services that would be fantastic if you wouldn't mind no problem! Here is the link to that service: http://library.cmu.edu/using/requesting You will want to use the ILLIad service on the left-hand side thank you kindly for your help, it is much appreciated!! When first using this system, you will have to fill out some information on yourself so that we can get the article to you My pleasure! Then after that, you would just fill out a journal article request with as much citation information that you can provide and our team will find a copy of it for you from other libraries wonderful, thank you! you are very welcome! Is there anything else that I can help you with today? no i think that's it, i hope you have a great afternoon thank, you! You do the same Thanks for contacting us today :)

Hi. I was wondering how to access journal impact factor stats (specifically, for psychology journals, if that matters). Thanks! Hi We have "the" library tool for that.  It's called "Journal Citation Reports.  You can find it in our Databases A to Z listing. On our library home page, look for "Research Databases." Just under the big blue "Everything" search box. ok... Let me know if you need help locating the database.  Can you give me a journal title that you want to check? So I'm at the Sign In for that. Should I just use my cmu login info? If it asks for one ... are you off campus? right, I'm off-campus now/ Yes, andrew id and password. It's not accepting my andrew id/pwd. (or my full cmu email address). Hmm ... that's not good.  Our computing services folks can likely help with that.  How many titles do you want to check for their impact factor.  I could look some up for you. I was able to VPN to get in. Good.  It should work with that.  Computing Services would be 412-268-4357 (for getting the proxy server to work for remote access). thanks for your help. Are you able to look up the journals and get their IF? yes. not 100% intuitive, but figured it out :-) Great.  Is there anything else that I can help you with today? I understand! nope. thanks again! have a good day. All kinds of measures for journals now too.

I'm having trouble accessing an article from off campus Hi I'm logged in through cisco, and haven't had trouble with any others, but this one takes me to a site and says I need to log in What are you trying to access  Should I link the CMU library page of the article? Yes-or send the citation.  I need to know what you're trying to access. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-s1066-53fb55929d87ed8992096f154cfad67eb9bd2811ca984c08b79aa1a26e9ee03d3 Thanks-let me check this out-just a minute, please Of course OK, I clicked on the full text link, it took me to the db and then I was able to download it.  When I use either "get it @CMU" or "full text" I am taken to "Samemobilus.sae.org" and asked to log in saemobilus  How about trying it from the proxy link-let me send that to you.   Oh...I see what might be the problem.  It's a test database. I don't have a proxy link to send you (proxy=you sign in with your andrew user id and psswd). I am proxy'd in through CMU, though it might not be explicitly to the library server. Would that perhaps help, if its not what I am already on? Did you go into the SAE Digital Library or the SAE Mobilus Link? The exact page I get is a subscription login https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/2016-01-0359 is the page I am sent to No, got that, thanks, but how did you get to the article-google search, google scholar, via one of our datbases (from link on library's homepage) Library search page To be honest, I'm not sure why you're not getting in. Let me look at something. Is this the only article you need from SAE? Its the only one I've tried to access from the site so far, no idea if I'll be trying to access it again later at the moment I can just send it to you and report problem. That works for me Yeah....I get you. I don't quite see any reason why it shouldn't work, esp. with the VPN. What browser are you using (I know I will be asked that). Chrome Thx-also send me your email. chasenr is my andrewid Thx-just a minute-I'm on with our tech person. He checked everything and it all looks good on our end (going to correct server, etc).   One thing to try if you want to search for more SAE articles is to go to the SAE db link we provide on the homepage-go to Search and find, then Research DB, then S for SAe and go from there. If you're not somehow already authenticated, then you should get a prompt to authenticate. That worked It went through an authentication and I can see the site Excellent! and the article should be in your email. Perfect, thank you You're very welcome That's all I have so I'm closing this window. Have a good day.

Hi hi I am a PhD student in mech engineering I was wondering if I can request CMU library to add subscription to ASME digital collection I'll need to refer you to your liaison librarian.  Let me get the contact information for you Sure Lynn Berard lberard@andrew.cmu.edu

I located a link to the HathiTrust catalog: https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002137795 Hello again! The publication I am seeking can be found there:  1180-a-1b Okay, great!

Hi, I've located a book that I would like to check out. Call number states it is located at the stacks at the Software Engineering Institute, but when I look up that building's library it only references a digital (not physical) library... Where may I go to locate this book? hi can you give me the title of the book so I can check the record and see what it says? Franklin Toker:  Pittsburgh: an urban portrait F159 .P63 T65 Thx-just a sec.  BTW, there is a physical libray in the SEI.  BRB. other copies at hunt are either reference only or appear to be out OK.  There is a paper copy at the SEI Library.  Hunt Library is supposed to have 3 copies.  The Hunt 4th floor reference copy is missing.  There should be a copy on the 2nd floor, and also a copy on the 4th floor. arent' the copies on second and fourth floor reference, or may they be checked out (i'm faculty, if that makes a difference) No, copies on the 2nd and 4th floors are circulating copies.  Only reference copies are non-circulating.  And status doesn't really make a difference. OK thank you! You're very welcome!

hi,  hello how may i help? is there a way to see the books that I have checked out previously? I did not save it in the search section of my account no, once books are returned they are erased from your records .. privacy matter however .. may I give you a future alternative? sure Do you know what Mendeley is? yes, i use it but forgot to log the book into it good .. and sorry that you forgot  I think that's really the only way .. you may have been able to add it to your "book bag" but I am not certain how long that's kept .. if you want I can check i checked .. book bags don't stay after you leave the search page .. sorry wait .. i stand corrected .. here's how you do this: when you go to the library page, make sure you are logged in (there's a login link on the top right). once you are, you can select the books you find and add them to Book Bag, on the very bottom ... that said, you have to remember to do that :( otherwise, you wouldn't have a saved list. I hope that helps thank you. I am gng to jog my memory to see if i can recollect you're welcome .. do you remember any keywords? what it's about? I may be able to help with that .. it was about clean air act ok .. let me do a quick search I did an advanced search and "clean air act" as a subject ..  here's a list of results ...  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Results?join=AND&bool0%5B%5D=AND&lookfor0%5B%5D=clean+air+act&type0%5B%5D=Subject&lookfor0%5B%5D=&type0%5B%5D=AllFields&lookfor0%5B%5D=&type0%5B%5D=AllFields&submit=Search&illustration=-1&daterange%5B%5D=publishDate&publishDatefrom=&publishDateto= either of these two? advanced search, i will use that to find it

Hi hi I'd like to order this book http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1257271 but it'sin Qatar and I'm a Pitt student and I need it urgently What would be the fastest way? and how long will it take? Well, there's no way we can get it for you from Qatar.  You need to do interlibrary loan or EZ Borrow from your home institution.  We even tell our own students to use ILL or EZ Borrow when there is a book they want and the only copy we have is in Qatar. I've requested a latest version of this book some 10 days ago through ILL, but still haven't received it. They may be having trouble finding the edition you want or an edition that is available. Is there any fixed time limit within which it is guaranteed to get a book through ILL ? no.  They will usually look until they find it.  There is usually a date on the ILL form after which it says they won't look.  You should talk to your ILL at Pitt about it. And whom should I reach out to, to check the status on the request? The online portal has only been showing 'Request Sent' since the last 10 days If you are a Pitt student, you need to talk to the ILL office at Pitt, where you placed the request.  If you do not know where that is, ask at  Hillman Library, Univeristy of Pittsburgh. You can contact the librarians at Pitt via their chat service: http://www.library.pitt.edu/askalibrarian Got it. Thanks! You're welcome! Wait This link is for UPitt it seems. I'm a CMU student. Is it same for us? You said you were a Pitt student! "but it'sin Qatar and I'm a Pitt student" oh-you meant you were Pitt student usually people say Pitt campus-got it. I thought you meant you were a u of Pitt student!! Too many Pitts!!! You can call our ILL office at 412-268-3030. All ILL offices try to get items as quickly as they can. You can also see the status of your ILL.  If you went into your ILL account and saw request sent, that means the request was sent out.  they usually send out a few libraries in the request.  If the first one says no, then it bounces to the second, if the second one won't lend either, then it goes to the third in line.   Even though libraries may have copies, the book may be checked out, on reserve (not available for ILL), etc.  This is especially true of recent books. Hold it just a minute-I need to check somethign.. See if you can get into this link http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780321550187 Hahaha! Yeah I meant Pitt campus. I'm accessing this through CMU library portal and though Pitt would mean Pitt campus when talking about Qatar. I can access the link above. Seems like if I sign in I can go through the ebook Should I use my andrew credentials? great! are you on campus or on the network? I'm at home connected to VPN OK, if you're on the VPN that should work.  I got in and I'm on the network, but I didn't have to login.  I'm not even sure how or why I got in.  We recently got Safari books (collection of e-books), but I searched our collection and didn't see this title. I found this via  the Worldcat database, gave the link a try and got in! Wierd! I was just hoping it would work for you.   Do you need the whole book or just a chapter? I see a link where it says 'use Safari via Public Library Account' but its not working for some reason. I'll try again from the library network. Thanks a lot for the prompt responses. http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780321550187 You're welcome!

Hi Hello I am trying to get the book "
Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for generalized causal inference" The system says that there is a copy available at Software Engineering Institute - STACKS How do I go about obtaining the book? Call Number:	BD591 .S48 2002	 You have a couple choices. 1) Go to the SEI library and check it out. 2) Recall the Hunt Library copy. 3) Place an interlibrary loan request. Where is the SEI library? The SEI Library is located at 4500 Fifth Avenue. You must take your CMU ID and sign in with the security guard. And, how can I recall the hunt library copy? option 3 sounds complicated..  When you are viewing the CAMEO catalog record for that book, there will be a PLACE HOLD link next to the due date. Click on that link and sign in to your account. Ok I'll go for option 1. What are the hours of the SEI library? Let me try to find that out. http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/borrow/otherlib/sei Ok, great! Thanks for your help You are welcome.

I would like to find the following paper: Hi! Do you have a link to the paper or citation information? I would like to find the following paper: Effects of interviewer's race, sex, and distance on visual and verbal interaction. Presented at the meetings of the American Psychological Association, Toronto, 1984.  Okay, let me see what I can find. you are a gem - thanks Have you checked our catalogue yet, by chance> ?* no I went right to the expert - you the researchers were Donna E. Thompson; John R. Aiello Okay, sounds good! I found it listed on John R. Aiello's CV, but may have a difficult time finding it as a paper. He lists it as a "Paper Read at Meetings". I'm hoping that it was published! is there someway to download articles-papers presented at the conference? american psychological association 1984 conference There may be a way through one of our databases. I'm going to check that one now. I just checked to see if I could find it published in a journal and so far no luck. Okay, our psychology databases are not coming up with anything as well.  Did you find this reference cited in another article? no on his website - this might be a needle in a haystack - let me know when you are done researching or other options - many thanks Thanks for that info and sorry for the delay. I fell into researching mode there for a second That's also what I keep finding; his website and CV It looks like this may have been an unpublished work that they read at the conference. I can't even find it in a Proceedings of the.... kind of thing One suggestion I have is to contact the author directly I can also give you the contact info for our Psychology Liaison to see if she has any other suggestions sure Great!  She is actually on chat now and I will transfer this chat to her Her name is Ana :) Hello, I'm Ana, the psychology librarian.  Ryan filled me in a little but please give me a minute to read your request Alright, I am looking to see if I can find anything from an APA program thank you so much Hello, I have to agree with Ryan's finding that it does not seem that any paper was published for this work.  I was able to find the published proceedings of the 92nd convention of APA but it does not include abstracts or conference papers of the work presented.  Looking at John Aiello's CV it is unclear to me that this work was ever published as a paper, at least on it's own. There is no work listed that appears similar in content based on the titles.  As you may know, this is often the case with psychology conference findings, a conference presentation often reflects work in progress which may not ever be published in a peer reviewed journal.  If you are very keen to know the results of this work I would suggest contacting the authors to ask if they have any record of their findings, however given it was more than 30 years ago you may not have much luck.  I'm sorry I wasn't able to help further. Is there anything else I can help with?  that is fine and thanks - I will write to Aiello and see if i can get a copy - many thanks for the sluething You are welcome. 

hi, IDG works with corporates on Leadership & Management enhancement. Want to know details of how we can subscribe/become a member to your research content. hi .. what do you mean by our research content? our databases? yes your database for journals, ebooks, articles You must be a current student, staff, or faculty to access our databases.  There's no licensing for non-affiliates.  Special patron borrowing only allows for using the print collections on site - https://libwebspace.library.cmu.edu/libraries-and-collections/Forms/Special%20Patron%20Application.pdf  you can come in person to use our databases by getting a temporary pass (you'll need a state ID).   But there's no remote accessibility. Does that clarify matters?

Hi  Hi I am looking for Vapor Deposition Market by Technology (Chemical Vapor Deposition, Physical Vapor Deposition), by End-user Industry (Microelectronics, Cutting tools, Industrial &amp; Energy, Medical, Decorative Coating)  Global Trends &amp; Forecast to 2019 I see.  That's a very specific market research report.  We do have a fair amount of this type of material, let's see if this is available (or at least something a lot like it).  These things can be dreadfully expensive. I need it for a proposal I am drafting An older version might work as well I'm guessing that this was found via a general  Internet search?  Correct? thats correct Ok.  Let me share where I'm starting out.  Our Business and Economics librarian maintains some great guides for us.  You may wish to open the URL I'm about to send in a new window.  One moment. okay http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper I am there in the Tepper Ryan always suggests that people start with the Industries tab for market research. Why don't you look at the Industries tab while I explore the report that you identified. Sure..  Okay ... it's from Markets and Markets and has a price tag in excess of $5,000.  Unless we find it in our resources, it may be financially out of our reach.  So, let's see what we can find in Ryan's suggested resources... I am looking there It seems there is stuff I can get my hands on from there Yes, we spend a good deal of money on them, so use them a lot.  :-) I'm currently poking around IBISWorld and used the phrase in quotes "chemical vapor deposition."  Note that the reports that crop up will be similar in nature to what you were originally looking for.  The key will be finding the report that meets your specific needs. I would strongly recommend reaching out to Ryan Splenda directly so that you can learn from him in depth (if you have the time).  (412) 268-2453, rsplenda@andrew.cmu.edu I am looking into bcc research Sounds good! IBISWorld's Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing in the US might be of interest, but it's missing the global scope.  I'll try another resource. I found one report with a global scope in MarketLine ... but chemical/physical vapor deposition would at best be a market segment. Thanks in marketline I will check it out I'm trying Frost & Sullivan.  Whenever I find something there it seems to be quite helpful. Frost & Sullivan looks primed to help you out quite a bit.  See what you think. what is the link or the key words Sorry.  Phone call.  I used "chemical vapor deposition" okay  "Physical vapor deposition" results are numerous as well (some overlap).  You may wish to use the British spelling vapour as well. ... or plain old "vapor deposition."  How are the Frost & Sullivan results looking? I am looking for IVD of aluminum  Trying to find those numbers is hard IVD? Ion vapor deposition Its part of CVD Oh .. okay.  I could have figured that out.  Sorry. Maybe using aluminum AND ion AND "vapor deposition" as your query might help in Frost & Sullivan. I had sent an email to Ryan Splenda and he feels Frost & Sullivan and BCC Research were the two most promising sources for you.  He would be glad to help all that he can.  He's at home sick today, but you can reach him via email. How about the term ... aluminum coatings? Specific title:  Emerging Trends in Aviation Coatings    [in Frost & Sullivan] Aluminide coatings? Are you have some success at this point?

Hello! Hope you can help me with a question. hi This is Prema Venkataraman hello! Hi Prema-how can I help you-this is Sue How do we get a thesis that is listed as Restricted Access. So sorry to hear about your mother. Is this listed in the Dissertations and Abstracts database, or did you see it somewhere else? Thanks Sue.  She suffered so much for the last 2 years that I am glad she is out of it.  Also got to see her 10days ago.  Thank you. My husband wanted it and I looked for it on the catalog.   can you give me author and title? Mechanistic studies of HF Adsorption on Alumina OK-let me check this out. Gillespie, A. R. 1997 I think interlibrary loan may be your only option.  This is at the bottom of the record at the University of Aukland: Restricted Item. Print thesis available in the University of Auckland Library or may be available through Interlibrary Loan. If your husband belongs to researchgate, (sort of like linked in, where you can post articles, etec.)  they seem to have a link to a PDF, but not sure how much is on there. Can we access researchgate or do you need subscription for that? PDF is what he would like  You just need to sign up.  I searched the title and basically it now says it will send an email to the author asking for the work. So it's not a PDF, they will send email to author: Do you want to send this request to the author? oh that will be fine.  And the best and easiest way to get the information. So do I click on the authors name for the email? let me just check worldcat to see if any us library has it.  As for clicking-I guess so, I've never done a request like that before either! No US library has this, only the University of Aukland and the University of New South Wales, so I'd go the author route. So I'd suggestjoinging Researchgate, search for the title, then when it asks if you want to sent the request via email to the author click yes.   Otherwise, your only option is ILL and of course we will do ILL with New Zealand. It will just take time. Ok thank you so much.   You're welcome, Prema. Take care. That was very helpful.  Could not have figured that one out myself. It wasn't a simple one! Bye! Bye, Prema!

Hello Hi I have some books checked out that I need for a research paper due just before Thanksgiving break.  They are due on November 4th, and I've already renewed them once.  Is there anyway for me to renew them again? If you can't renew them again online, then you'll need to bring them into the library and you can renew in person as long as no one has a hold on them (you would have gotten an email asking you to bring the books back if someone had). Is there anyway for me to renew them in person without bringing in the physical books?  I live off campus, and it is a decent number of books.  I can come in in person, I'd just like to not have to carry around several books all day if I don't absolutely have to. As far as I know, no, you need to bring them in.  You can double check with circulation by calling 412-268-2444 Ok, thank you You're welcome! You  can always bring them in a few at a time. Yeah, I would have, but at this point they are due on Friday and I forgot to do it sooner oops....time does fly this time of year!! It sure does Well, consider paying a fine if you have to: Books	25Î¢ http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/borrow/fines I'll probably just bring them in tomorrow (I called the circulation desk, you were right, I do have to bring them in) Yeah, that's what I thought.  Just suck it up, bring it in, and then you can relax about it.  And also save the money for a cup of coffee or something else! ;-) You'll feel so virtuous when it's done! Yup :) Thank you for your help! You're welcome! Have a great day! :-) Same to you :) Thx!

Hi, I want to get "Good Analytical Research" . http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638180.2011.559030 Can I get the paper? Thanks! hi are you on campus? Yes ok .. let me check to see if we have access to this article .. but so far it looks like you have to place an interlibrary loan for it I'll wait! it looks like we have access to it... did you go through the ejournals link? Yes.. but I couldn't get it Maybe I don't know how to do ok .. so go to eJournals and type the journal name "European Accounting Review" you'll see access is available via Business Source Premier Click on it, then on the right, choose 2011, then issue 1.  The article should be 4th or so How can I search for the paper? Oh I got it! Thanks!! great .. anything else? No. thanks! great .. have a good day

Hi, I'm Danielle, a CMU Tepper MBA student doing my summer internship right now in marketing. I'm trying to access the Global Industry Analysts report from May 2017 on "Global Feminine Hygiene Products Industry." Do I have access to this as a student? I haven't been able to find it through online searching on the library's site. Thank you!  Hi Danielle! Let me check on this report Great thank you! Odds are we do not have access to it if you found it on the web first. My name is Ryan Splenda by the way, I am the Business & Econ Librarian Oh hi! Yes, I think we've met briefly before. Do you have the link for this report by chance? Or do you remember which market research company produced it? If we don't have access to that specific report, would you be able to point me in the right direction for any global reports on feminine care/hygiene? I'm working at Kimberly-Clark on the U by Kotex brand this summer (tamping, pads, etc.). Yes, I've done some searching and it looks like we don't have access to this.  This is often the case with some of these reports However, there are other databases to try for the female hygiene industry Here's the link: http://bit.ly/2sMJpFH The one you may consider first is Passport, which can be found here: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=passport Thanks for the link. We don't have it unfortunately. Let me check in some of our databases I'll check on Passport now  Thank you! Okay, it is a bit tricky Another one to try is MarketLine http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=marketline MarketLine has "Personal Hygiene" industry reports for a number of countries and may have a global one as well There is a report in Passport called "Beauty and Personal Care Global Industry Overview" that may be of help I'll take a look at that. I also looked at the company overviews for K-C, Proctor & Gamble, and others Yes! Great idea! I was just going to suggest taking a look at the companies that make up the market as well.  Company profiles in MarketLine, Mergent Online, and NetAdvantage could be helpful Mergent Online: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=mergent%20online NetAdvantage: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=global%20netadvantage The file I just shared is the report from Passporty Passport* Also found a "Global - Personal Hygiene" report in MarketLine as well. Select industries in that database and type that exact phrase to get i hope that these databases and reports help. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at rsplenda@andrew.cmu.edu Thank you, Ryan! I just downloaded a bunch of reports and will sift through them today. I'll definitely follow up if I have any other questions.  My pleasure, Danielle! So glad this was helpful! Good luck with your internship :)

Hello! My name is Daniel Manners and I am a senior at CMU.  For my class EPP Projects, my group is researching the benefits and impacts of Police Body Worn Cameras (BWCs).  One area we are examining is "transparency" and we want to see how available video footage from BWCs is to local Pittsburgh media.  Does the library offer resources or subscriptions to Pittsburgh Post Gazette, CBS Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Tribune Review, ABC, and WPXI, and any other similar sources?  We would like to search through their articles or archives to find mentions of BWCs.  Thank you. Hi I'm reading your message right now ... one moment. I've used the e-Journals list on the library's home page to determine that we do have access for the full text of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette back to 1993.  We also have access to an archive of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Blog. Let me see if I can find the others using the E-journals list.  You'll find the E-journals list just below the blue "Everything" search box. I'm finding the Pittsburgh Tribune Review listed there as well.  I expected that.  Now for the TV sources ... this I'm a bit unsure of.  Let's see what I find. Ok thank you, I am looking as well It looks like the national TV transcripts are available via our E-journals list.  Still digging. Thanks.  This is enough for me to go on actually, as long as I know where to look I can do the searching.  eJournals seems to have most of what I'm looking for. I would suggest that we ask the Hunt Library librarians about TV archives (I'm in the Sorrells Engineering & Science Library). I could pass along your contact information to the Hunt Reference email service.

Hello Hi! How can I help? Do you have this book :  Statistical Analysis of fMRI Data, by Gregory Ashby Let me check and see thanks You are welcome. One moment please Okay, it looks like we do not have this book. We have a similar book called "Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data" here: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1608480 If you need the exact book that you mentioned though, you can request it using our interlibrary loan service More info on that can be fond here:http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting (use the ILLIAD service on the left) Sorry, here's the link: http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting Are you still there? yes thanks. I was wondering if it is possible to access to an online version of the book I know it was published with MIT press I see.  Do you have any agreement with them ? We don't have the book available at all though Is this for a psychology course? No, research for my dissertation Oh I see.  Are you a PhD in psychology? philosophy Okay, thanks for that Here's what I would suggest: we have a liaison librarian to philosophy.  His name is Ethan Pullman. His contact information can be found here: http://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/ethan-pullman If you contact him, he may be willing to buy an e version of this book ok. thanks a lot. You are welcome! Is there anything else that I can help you with today?

Hello there! It looks like the book I want is in the stacks -- in Qatar. Can you all send out a more local query? The book is called Contemporary Issues in Business Ethics, and here's the link. http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1257615 You will have to order the book via our Interlibrary Loan system ILLiad http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting is that enough information?  the ISBN # isn't listed. You don't need the ISBN to request it. but I can get it for you ISBN that is that's OK - if I don't need it, I'm sure you have better things to do. You can click on the record's MARC record and retrieve that info from Library's catalog 9781600217739 (hardcover)   or 1600217737 (hardcover)   and well, there you have it! CMU librarians rock. thank you very much.

Thank you - the "Online Access" access link on that page brings me to the springer website, which appears to be paywalled. Am I not accessing it correctly? Are you still logged into the Library Resources VPN? Yes I just tried it and the same thing happened. It looks like we don't have access to this book. But let me try one thing. I tried several things and still couldn't access it on campus. Unfortunately, it may be a bad library catalog record. I can look into it for you if you would like to share your email address with me. That's okay, I appreciate your help, I'll find another reference :) It also appears the springer login is having some problems, so it might be a validation error on their end. My email is mjlevine@andrew.cmu.edu if something comes up, but it's no problem, there are other books :) Thank you for bringing it to our attention! I will keep you posted if I find anything out! Great, have a nice day

Hi, I'm a Pitt Graduate Student working at Pitt's Hillman Library's Special Collections. I wanted to read this resource I've only been able to find at Hunt Library: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/372071 Hello It looks like this is something at our off-site storage facility. Let me look into how we can request it for you. Thank you so much! I spoke to our circulation dept. head. You should be able to request the book through E-ZBorrow. E-ZBorrow says that it's not requestable Yes. Let me make one change and then you should be able to request it. Though my change may not take effect until tomorrow. Ah, I see. I made a change to the record on the back end of our catalog. You can check again now -- but I am going to guess that it won't show as available to request until tomorrow. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me directly. Jill Chisnell, jillianc@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-6330. Thank you so much, Jill. So you'll recognize me if I write, my name is Staci Ross (str51@pitt.edu). Have a great day! Same to you! And it works! Oh great! Thank you, take care.  You are welcome.

Hi! I'm trying to access the Journal of Engineering Design. ok a particular volume? or citation?

Do University Libraries have library liaisons to assist students with research? of course! Tell us your dept and/or school and we'll link you up! Thanks, is there a link that lists them all? yes-I'll send it along in the next-let me find it.  It's on our web pages Excellent--thanks! http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/expert If you click on the "Plus" you'll see the full list. Thanks! You're welcome! Have a good day-- You too! :-)

Hi, I need the EZProxy URLto the library.  I'm using Papers app 3.2.8 to manage my literature review Hi. I will try to locate that for you ... one moment. thanks This should be it:  http://search.library.cmu.edu/link/  Let me know if it doesn't work.  I'm Matt Marsteller at matthewm@andrew.cmu.edu if we get disconnected Let me know if does work as well.  :-) ok thanks! Any luck? Nope. But I'm reinstalling the app to see if it works  Ok ... I'm messaging our IT guy for help. It seem like Papers app doesn't have access to internet :( That seems odd ... they highlight that feature of being able to search library databases.   Does the maker of Papers have a chat box or email help address? If it gets too aggravating, consider using Mendeley or Zotero.  I'll send you a link ... http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/tools I know both of them work, but in a different way.  When you're in a library database, it's easy to save records to them.  They also work from an article's web page as well. There is a comparison of bibliographic management tools at:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/CitationTools Sure, I've used Zotero for my first paper, but my advisor bought tPapers license for the research group, so she is expecting us to used it I see.  That trumps everything. But I will make my case for Zotero then! Thanks! Best of luck.

sorry for the late reply How can I have access to the 2007 edition? I tried search in the library website and don't see it hi- hi the librarian you were chatting with left, sorry I was distracted by something else so I'm trying to piece together your question-is this what you want:http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1642788 unfortunately it's not It's a different handbook How long does it take to request the library to buy the book in the link I sent before? I don't have that link-that's the problem, so I can't find you the 2007 edition you were asking about.  Depending if it was ordered rush or not, which I also can't tell, it could take a few days. http://www.madcad.com/store/subscription/ASHRAE-Guideline-20-2010-RA2016/ This is the link of the ASHRAE guideline I need Thank! Actually it's not like a book, more like a 8-page report/paper I think it's a digital version OKI-you were asking about the 2007 edition, but I don't see it either. The only  ASHRAE 2007 I found was the link I gave you, and if that's not it, we don't have it.  I just talked to the librarian you were chatting with before and she confirmed that the 2007 she thought we had was the link I gave you.   Yeah, thanks for confirming me with that.. What I need is ASHRAE Guideline 20-2010 (RA 2016) - Documenting HVAC&R Work Processes and Data Exchange Requirements, it's not the same book you sent to me in the link. I also don't think there seems to be a 2007 version, the one I need is first published in 2010 I think. So if this is a digital version, I am wondering will it be fast to get the document if I request it We don't have it-you'll need to use our interlibrary loan service if you need to get something we don't have, as long as you are a CMU affiliated person.  Here's the link http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting Usually interlibrary loan takes about 5 days If you want a librarian to consider buying it, let me know what dept you are in and I will give you the contact info for that librarian I see, thanks for letting me know! I will probably buy it myself as it's not expensive Thanks for the help´_ You're welcome!

Hey. I was searching for " Probability, random variables, and stochastic processes /
by Papoulis, Athanasios, "  Hello It says that it has been checked out. However, there is one available in QAXXX  Can you check if it's available at the sorrells library The link:  http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1041899 It looks like all copies at Sorrells are checked out. You can place a hold on the title which will recall the item after it's been checked out for seven days. However, it can be recalled from you seven days after you check it out. You can also try interlibrary loan. However, it could be a difficult book to get due to popularity. Hmm. OK. Will place a hold instead. It says Nov, 27 2016 that the book be returned by the current owner. However, placing a hold on the book cannot change this right?  If you place a hold on a title, the person who has that title currently checked out will receive a notice that they must return it.  All books can be recalled after 7 days of check out. So placing a hold on the book means I have a slim chance of getting the book i suppose? In a few weeks.. Yes. But it could be recalled from you after one week. So what if I want it till the end of the fall semester?  In my experience, that probably won't happen as it is a very popular book and most likely to be recalled.  Alrighty. Thanks for the info. Have a nice day! Have a nice day.

Hi! Hi I am Jaya, first year MBA Student. Hi Jaya-what can I help you with? I need to borrow a book. But i don't know how to do it. Could you please help me! Sure. First you need to search our catalog to see if we have the book.  The easiest way to do that might be to use our advanced search.  Our homepage, with the catalog in simple search is www.library.cmu.edu and here's the link to the advanced search  http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Advanced (more to come) Once you find the record for the book and see that it is available, you come into the library and retrieve the book.  Take the book, with your CMU ID card to the circulation desk on the 1st floor and they will charge (check out) the book to you.  You'll be give a date the book is due back (more to come) Can i reserve the book? and collect it later If we don't have the book, then you can use either EZ Borrow or interlibrary loan to get a copy of the book -here's the link for those services.  http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting no, our books are first come first serve, so if it is available, you cannot reserve it.  However, if it is checked out, you can put a hold on it What does Hold means? That means the person who has the book is told to bring the book in because someone else wants it.  They get to have it for 7 days, then must bring it back so the person who wants it (who placed the hold) can get it. When it comes back the person who put the hold on it is notified it is available. Thanks! Have a nice day You're very welcome! :-)  You have a good day as well!

Hi there, hoping you can help me get a pdf of this article. The links are not generating a file for me -- maybe too old (the file, not me)? http://search.proquest.com.proxy.library.cmu.edu/docview/196653232?accountid=9902 Let me try.  I was not able to retrieve the article either. You can get access by registering for Research gate at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264785536_Harry_Potter_and_the_health_of_the_environment great, thanks very much!

hi hi i was looking at this book: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1728418 i find it hard to practice the code from ebook format.. is there any chance I can take a print of this book ? Let me see if we have a print copy and check into other options. sure.. thank you I checked a database that covers world wide library holdings (Worldcat) and most libraries have the ebook vrsion.  And sadly, we only have that version as well.  One option, perhaps print out the pages you need - You'll probably have to do it one page at a time. Other option-put in an Interlibrary loan request asking for the print edition only. You may want to include in the notes that you know we have the e-book version, but that you need the print.  What department are you in? CEE it is not a traditional civil engineering book You could ask your librarian, lberard@andrew.cmu.edu, if she'd consider buying the paper copy. to justify asking the dept to buy this one hmm.. alright.. thank you so much for your time... Ironically, the E&S library is buying more and more ebooks and I don't know how willing she'd be to buy paper-but you could always ask. i guess ebooks are the way forward.... and everyone will be forced to adapt and get comfortable with that format in the future.. have a great day! thanks again! You too- you are very welcome!

Hi! I'm trying to access the book Closure by Nancy Berns, and a library says that we have access to an online version of this text. However, when I follow the provided link, there is no record of it. Sorry, a library search says that we have access to an online version. ok let me check  i can't get to it via the link either...let me check further... sorry to keep you waiting not a problem! we don't seem to have access right now.  I suggest that you go thru our InterLibrary loan system to request it also... the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Main Oakland branch has a print copy of it.... if you give me your email I can email you after I check into problems on our end. okay, my email is eferris@andrew.cmu.edu i appreciate your help with this and I am Donna at donnab@andrew.cmu.edu

I'd like to get a paper that is not available by eJournal.  Smith,O.J., Chem. Eng. Prog. 53 (1957) p. 217 to end of article.

Good afternoon Hi I am looking for the book titled "Fundamentals of Brain Network Analysis" I found a link of this book on ebrary but I am unable to download it can you please help me One can find links to lots of e-books, but the key is, did the libraries buy it so you have the right to access the material?  You can find that out by checking our catalog, just like a regular book.  I'll check for you. ok Do you have an author by any chance?  we should have access to the e-book "Fundamental of Brain Network Analysis,"  (though someone is using at this time), but we don't have access to "Fundamentals of Brain Network Analysis" (not fundamentals is pleural here, singular in the other, and they have different authors/editors). One of the author is Alex Fornito OK-this is it-http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1757717 But note that it is one user at a time, and someone is currently using it.  When available, one should be able to click on the URL (click on the words single user) and be taken to the text of the book.  oh alright thanks  I will check back later then  There's no way of telling when this book will be free, so yeah, you'll just have to check back later. Thank you and good day . You're very welcome, and you have a good day as well! :-)

Hello hello  i have a quick question about online library access.  do you offer subscriptions for non student faculty to access academic journals? I don't know what you mean by non student faculty...are you affiliated with Carnegie Mellon? no You can access our online services/resources ONLY if you come to one of our physical locations. ok thank you Some researchers can get permission to get a research pass where you would not have to request a login at each visit but you would still have to come to campus go it thank you for the information

http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1762734  This item has a broken URL, and I can't find it by searching at Ebsco.  Do you have another link to access this?  Thank you. Hi! (The full text URL doesn't work) HI Okay, let me see what I can find Thank you You are welcome Okay, it looks like we have 2 difference records for this eBook.

Hello, I have a question regarding putting course materials on reserve Hi If a book is listed in "Arts Reference" up on the 4th Fl does that mean this is essentially already "on reserve" and cannot be checked out? http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1440374 Arts reference books are books that cannot be checked out without permission from a reference librarian.  so in some way they are on reserve, i.e. need special permission to be checked out.  Unfortunately no arts reference librarians are on chat, so if you want to pursue this further with them, you can send email to artsref@andrew.cmu.edu.  One thing different about books on reserve vs. reference is that reference books are on open shelves, and anyone can take them anywhere in the library. ok great, I will reach out to them thanks! When books are on reserve, they are  kept at the Circ desk and students have to sign them out with their CMU IDs, so there is more accountability. can reference books be placed on reserve? The arts librarian is Mo Dawley, md2Z@andrew.cmu.edu if you want to contact her directly. I believe so, but you may want to talk with Mo directly. You could also just fill out the form, and if there is a problem, the reserves associate will contact you. ok great, thanks You're welcome!

Hi I'm a graduate student at Pitt, looking for a book that is available online at CMU libraries. Do I have to physically be on the CMU campus to access it, or is there a way for me to view it using my Pitt ID? Hi! Good to here from you. Can you give me the book title please? Sexing la mode : gender, fashion and commercial culture in old regime France Thanks! One moment please :) Okay, I did find the book and am checking on the policy now with our circulation supervisor All right, thank you! No problem! Okay, it looks like we have a little digging to do on our end about this. Our circulation supervisor, Ona Taylor, said to try and access the book with your Pitt credentials. If that fails, you can contact her because she is looking into it further. Her contact information can be found here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/ona-taylor I also took a quick look to see if the Carnegie Public Library has this book, and they do! Here is there catalog record: https://librarycatalog.einetwork.net/Record/.b26610322/Home?searchId=42692557&recordIndex=1&page=1 The Carnegie Public Library is right across Schenley Plaza from Hillman Library (main library at Pitt). If your access to CMU fails and Ona can't find another solution. This could be an extra back up option Perfect, thank you so much! You are welcome! Can I help you with anything else today?

How do I check out the ebook in my bookbag? hello! One moment please ok You will not be able to check the book out from the book bag, so you'll want to search for it's title through CMU's catalog search  ok, then what? You should be able to tell if the book is available online in ebook format from your search  yes, it is https://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1519384 how do i access the text? If you click the "Multiple user" link it will direct you to your text  oh! i just tried that. okay. thanks. Were you able to access the text? yes. now i am trying to figure out if there's a way to print out a chapter. It does seem like you can download the text and there is a print button at the top of the text ok, thanks. the download link gave me a ".acsm" rather than a pdf, so i can't open it unfortunately, but i'm trying the built-in print function now. The print option does look much more usable than the download option, so hopefully that will work for you. Let me know if you need any additional help! success! thanks for your help :) You're welcome!

There's one for Sorrells library too - http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Search/Advanced sorry - meant this one -http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1451192 Thank you! you're welcome!

Hello! I'm an alumna, doing some consulting work, and I am hoping to get in-library access to a journal you have in offsite storage. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/282596 I need the fall 1970 one (it's hard to tell from the record whether that is TK7885 .A1 J6 VOL. 36 1970 or TK7885 .A1 J6 VOL. 37 1970, but I would guess it's the latter. Is that possible? hi Hi :)  Again, I wouldn't want to remove it from the library. I would just need to look at it and make a scan of a couple of pages (totally fair use). Do you have the title of what you want-I'm asking because there's a link in the record, and we may have what you need electronically. I can't use an electronic version, unfortunately; I have to put my hands on a bound copy. (Well, it doesn't have to be bound.) (But a physical copy.) If you come to the library, fill out a form, you can get a guest password for computer access for 2 hours and use the db.  I can't use the electronic copy, unfortunately The consulting I'm doing is legal in nature. They need someone to get access to the physical item. sorry, I just checked and the only people who get material from our offsite facility are those with a CMU ID card. You could go to a public library and put in an interlibrary loan request. Would a special borrowers card work, in the future? (I'm not sure there will be enough time to make this work, this time; this whole thing is due Tuesday. My clients didn't give me much time.) No, the special borrowers card does not work. It needs to be a CMU ID card.  The electronic is a PDF from the paper, as far as I can tell. If you tell me the article, give me your email, I can send it to you to use/not use as you and/or your client see fit. BTW if this is due by Tues, we probably wouldn't have had the time to retrieve it by then anyway.  Our library is closed Monday, no retrieval from offsite over the weekend. I appreciate the offer, but I can't use the electronic version. If you're curious, it's the one about the ALOHA system. It's a precursor to CDMA, which cell phones use now. Thanks for letting me know. And thanks for your help. Have a good long weekend! In terms of legality, I understand why you can't use.  Check with Pitt-maybe they can help. Have a good weekend as well. Thanks!

Ok thank you! Where is it available in print? hold on .. will get this for you http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/530823 Ok thanks. I think that is the first edition but I can probably also use it.  I cannot find it in JSTOR .. odd .. are you sure it wasn't EBSCO what department are you in?  You can request the ecopy to be purchased from your subject library any chance you are in the philosophy department? Yes, I'm sure it was on JSTOR. http://xx4ay4fv5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=jstor%3Ajstor&genre=book&eisbn=9780262329378&title=Thinking+Things+Through&isbn=9780262527200 No I'm not in the philosophy department ah .. it was part of a DDA (demand driven acquisition) .. a trial ..  hmmm ok thank you for your help. Is there anyway to get access to it again? ok .. do you know who the librarian for your department is?  I can get you in touch with them .. they can purchase it and let you know when it is available online. I do not know my librarian. It is the textbook used for Nature of Reason. I am currently enrolled in the course but am in the Material Science department.  I will just use the copy available in Hunt.  ah Lynn Berard is your subject librarian, but I'll go ahead and order an e-copy, since it is interdisciplinary with philosophy .. do you have an email I can reach you? I can let you know when it is available .. thanks nbudwal@andrew.cmu.edu great .. I'll let you know as soon as it is available .. thanks Thank you! You have been very helpful.  glad to help .. will that be it? Yep! great .. have a great day and will let you know the status soon Goodbye!
