Her contact information can be found here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/ona-taylor11:53AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I also took a quick look to see if the Carnegie Public Library has this book, and they do!

And sadly, we only have that version as well.  One option, perhaps print out the pages you need - You'll probably have to do it one page at a time.08:39AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Other option-put in an Interlibrary loan request asking for the print edition only. You may want to include in the notes that you know we have the e-book version, but that you need the print. 08:39AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: What department are you in?08:39AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: CEE08:40AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: it is not a traditional civil engineering book08:40AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You could ask your librarian, lberard@andrew.cmu.edu, if she'd consider buying the paper copy.08:40AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: to justify asking the dept to buy this one08:41AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: hmm..08:41AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: alright.. thank you so much for your time...08:41AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Ironically, the E&S library is buying more and more ebooks and I don't know how willing she'd be to buy paper-but you could always ask.08:43AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: i guess ebooks are the way forward.... and everyone will be forced to adapt and get comfortable with that format in the future..08:43AM 23063014216449546447164478@web.libraryh3lp.com: have a great day! thanks again!08:43AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You too- you are very welcome!"

Unfortunately no arts reference librarians are on chat, so if you want to pursue this further with them, you can send email to artsref@andrew.cmu.edu.  One thing different about books on reserve vs. reference15:26PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: is that reference books are on open shelves, and anyone can take them anywhere in the library.15:26PM 25601143358117305068210905@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok great, I will reach out to them thanks!15:27PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: When books are on reserve, they are  kept at the Circ desk and students have to sign them out with their CMU IDs, so there is more accountability.15:28PM 25601143358117305068210905@web.libraryh3lp.com: can reference books be placed on reserve?15:28PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The arts librarian is Mo Dawley, md2Z@andrew.cmu.edu if you want to contact her directly.15:28PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I believe so, but you may want to talk with Mo directly.15:29PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You could also just fill out the form, and if there is a problem, the reserves associate will contact you.15:32PM 25601143358117305068210905@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok great, thanks15:33PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're welcome!"

More about how retailers' energy usage. Eg. how much of Walmart's energy bill is used by water heaters13:10PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Ok-that's actually what I thought you meant.  Sigh...that's even more difficult that then other! I doubt any of our databases will cover this, unless it's in an article.  While we have dbs on market share, annual reports, I don't know that anyone has to report water heater energy used, or even what type of water heater they have.  Is this for a paper you're doing?? And just curious-what dept?13:11PM 71765621802822144709353192@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah, that's kind of what I expected. This is for a research project in business communications.

Can you tell me anything else about your project?14:14PM 15899484660037475939846104@web.libraryh3lp.com: So, I was wondering if there was anybody who would know more about the HigherEd side of the project, even if they didn't really know much about Information Systems14:14PM 15899484660037475939846104@web.libraryh3lp.com: The project has two parts, researching the industry and what is already available, and then developing a potential solution.14:16PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: OK.

All I know is that our databases are fit with a proxy that lets you login from anywhere as long as you have an Andrew user ID and Password.  Maybe the problem was that he was logging in with ""his"" WoS psswd.  To be authenticated, he needs to login with his Andrew user ID and psswd and then sign in if he's registered on WoS.13:06PM 89054923290093542788026015@web.libraryh3lp.com: Alright.

Once in WoS, he can login to use the special features (saved searches, etc.), assuming he registered to use them and that's what he means by loggin in with his WoS ID and psswd."

I'm an alumna, doing some consulting work, and I am hoping to get in-library access to a journal you have in offsite storage. http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/282596 I need the fall 1970 one (it's hard to tell from the record whether that is TK7885 .A1 J6 VOL. 36 1970 or TK7885 .A1 J6 VOL. 37 1970, but I would guess it's the latter. Is that possible?12:31PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: hi12:31PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: Hi :) 12:32PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: Again, I wouldn't want to remove it from the library. I would just need to look at it and make a scan of a couple of pages (totally fair use).12:33PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Do you have the title of what you want-I'm asking because there's a link in the record, and we may have what you need electronically.12:33PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: I can't use an electronic version, unfortunately; I have to put my hands on a bound copy.12:33PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: (Well, it doesn't have to be bound.)12:34PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: (But a physical copy.)12:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you come to the library, fill out a form, you can get a guest password for computer access for 2 hours and use the db. 12:35PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: I can't use the electronic copy, unfortunately12:36PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: The consulting I'm doing is legal in nature. They need someone to get access to the physical item.12:36PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: sorry, I just checked and the only people who get material from our offsite facility are those with a CMU ID card.12:37PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You could go to a public library and put in an interlibrary loan request.12:37PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: Would a special borrowers card work, in the future? (I'm not sure there will be enough time to make this work, this time; this whole thing is due Tuesday. My clients didn't give me much time.)12:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No, the special borrowers card does not work. It needs to be a CMU ID card.  The electronic is a PDF from the paper, as far as I can tell. If you tell me the article, give me your email, I can send it to you to use/not use as you and/or your client see fit.12:42PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: BTW if this is due by Tues, we probably wouldn't have had the time to retrieve it by then anyway.  Our library is closed Monday, no retrieval from offsite over the weekend.12:42PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: I appreciate the offer, but I can't use the electronic version. If you're curious, it's the one about the ALOHA system. It's a precursor to CDMA, which cell phones use now.12:42PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for letting me know. And thanks for your help.12:42PM 76402949082713519601859179@web.libraryh3lp.com: Have a good long weekend!12:43PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: In terms of legality, I understand why you can't use.

IŠ—Èm a film maker in the U.K. with an interesting copyright conundrum.I was looking at using the instrumental of Š—…Jitterbug WaltzŠ—È by Fats Waller. It was written in 1942 by Waller who died in 1943. Warner Chappell publishes in US and Sony ATV claim major territories ROW. ItŠ—Ès still in copyright in the U.S. However collection societies world wide (outside the U.S.) so far as I can see, show the work as public domain.Sony are saying that, because itŠ—Ès an original U.S. copyright they believe it is subject to U.S. copyright laws and therefore still in copyright outside the U.S. However they arenŠ—Èt 100% sure. There are a number of unanswered questions. Some relate to how and when Sony acquired the copyright such as Š—– was the copyright acquired through the ATV purchase and possibly subject to U.K. copyright periodŠ—_ and some are matters of law such as - are copyrights published outside the U.S. by a different publisher to the one in the U.S. (even if that publisher is currently U.S. based) subject to the of the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act?Sony is being slow in coming back. I suspect that the question is beyond most of their younger employees and is being pushed from desk to desk but no one is picking it up because itŠ—Ès a thorny problem and publishers instinctively donŠ—Èt like to lose control of anything.(To complicate it further there are claims in the British Reversionary Territories as well but I think thatŠ—Ès one for another day).Any help would be greatly appreciated. For me itŠ—Ès become as much a question of copyright in general as specific to the particular title.09:22AM 95252015094697582134702334@web.libraryh3lp.com: Peter09:23AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hi-09:23AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let me read your question09:23AM 95252015094697582134702334@web.libraryh3lp.com: Above was all neatly paragraphed for clarity but now all smooshed together.

The only  ASHRAE 2007 I found was the link I gave you, and if that's not it, we don't have it.  I just talked to the librarian you were chatting with before and she confirmed that the 2007 she thought we had was the link I gave you.  11:39AM 02995390059543265315771051@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah, thanks for confirming me with that.. What I need is ASHRAE Guideline 20-2010 (RA 2016) - Documenting HVAC&R Work Processes and Data Exchange Requirements, it's not the same book you sent to me in the link. I also don't think there seems to be a 2007 version, the one I need is first published in 2010 I think.11:40AM 02995390059543265315771051@web.libraryh3lp.com: So if this is a digital version, I am wondering will it be fast to get the document if I request it11:40AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We don't have it-you'll need to use our interlibrary loan service if you need to get something we don't have, as long as you are a CMU affiliated person.  Here's the link http://www.library.cmu.edu/using/requesting11:40AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Usually interlibrary loan takes about 5 days11:41AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you want a librarian to consider buying it, let me know what dept you are in and I will give you the contact info for that librarian11:41AM 02995390059543265315771051@web.libraryh3lp.com: I see, thanks for letting me know!11:41AM 02995390059543265315771051@web.libraryh3lp.com: I will probably buy it myself as it's not expensive11:41AM 02995390059543265315771051@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for the help´_11:41AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're welcome!"

There is a option to create a personal folder within the Safari Books Online application; you can save the book there, and then come back to it whenever you wish to read it.  11:29AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Here is the link I mean:  	http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/978013443396711:32AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: When you are ready, would you like to go through any other eBooks you have selected and see how to access them?  We use a variety of eBook vendors, and, unfortunately, they are all a bit different in terms of how to access or download (where possible) their books.11:33AM 13803876028770255645507324@web.libraryh3lp.com: I looked through the css3 ebook.

Can you send me the URL for the book from the catalog?16:34PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: When you have the full record up ... it will just be the URL16:34PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: URL for the catalog record.16:34PM 89326146722818828856978442@web.libraryh3lp.com: http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/1382208/Holdings#tabnav16:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Inside cyber warfare correct?16:36PM 89326146722818828856978442@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes16:37PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Could I have your andrew id?  I'll take the book record and your id to the Circulation desk here in Sorrells and see if they can place the hold for you.  Also, I'll check the shelf before that.  It's .... maybe 40 feet from my office.16:37PM 89326146722818828856978442@web.libraryh3lp.com: My andrew ID is karleunt16:38PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay ... you may find a copy at our SEI Library as well.

I think I have found it as well. Sometimes the ""full text"" results within some of the ProQuest results are a bit tricky. In this case this looks to be a post from a blog that has been provided through ProQuest.10:07AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This is often the case with market research reports in ProQuest as well. They end up being advertisements for the reports or in this case a blog, but the actual report is not available.10:07AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It is more of a press release announcing it in a way.10:08AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Are you with the Tepper School by chance?10:08AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes10:08AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, are you interested in the biometrics market?10:08AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes, i am interested in voice biometrics market 10:09AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, I can lead you to some comparable resources that we have that may yield some helpful results.10:09AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: great, thank you so much10:09AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I am the business librarian by the way.

BUT, if you find a report of interest and want the PDF, I have a way of getting those for you.10:15AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes, I find lots of article there. thank you so much10:15AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: so bcc % frost10:15AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: &amp;10:15AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You are welcome!10:16AM 95068837384843860488317461@web.libraryh3lp.com: my name is henry.

I tried a search of Westinghouse Electric, East Pittsburgh, PA, but it did not provide any info specifically about the East Pittsburgh location.10:21AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: hi10:21AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Are you a student at CMU?10:22AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm a staff member but am taking a history course currently.10:22AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: What type of source material are you looking for?  We don't have any at CMU.10:23AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I might be using the wrong term.  I'm looking for books/articles about the plant, specifically, the one in East Pgh.  I think it was the first plant that Westinghouse established.10:24AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm writing a paper about the borough of East Pittsburgh and the role the WEstinghouse played during that time in history.10:24AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Oh-that's totally different from source material, in the history world.  Source material is often meant as archival material...original sources from the day.10:25AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I was using the wrong term.  Sorry.10:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No problem...actually Pitt has some ""source"" material-e.g. http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?type=simple;c=ascead;view=text;subview=outline;didno=US-PPiU-ais19891610:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let me look at some databases and make a recommendation10:28AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There are very few articles in our prime history database ""America: History and Life.""  10:31AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Using the Dissertations and Theses databases got me a much more, 221 hits,  with the keywords East pittsburgh and westinghouse in the advanced search.  You could make this more relevant by limiting the terms to abstract, perhaps. Many would have the full text right there.  It's really difficult to find articles on really local history, such as East Pittsburgh (that's why they sometimes make good dissertation topics!)10:32AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: Could you send me the link for the dissertations/theses database?  Would I have access to it?10:34AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Both databases I mentioned are listed on our Database page.  go the the libraries' homepage, and click on Search and Find and you'll see the link for Research Databases.10:34AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I am finding it difficult to find info, outside of jubilee, biecentennial, and other events that East Pittsburgh celebrated and had a ""book"" made for distribution to the community folks.  I was fortunate enough to get a loan of that from a former EP resident.10:35AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, those are the things people tend to write about. 10:36AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: OK, thanks very much for your help with this.  Much appreciated.  10:36AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Sadly, we don't have an online database of Pittsburgh Newspapers, other than the Pittsburgh Courier (an African American newspaper, but still may be helpful)10:36AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Here is a guide that may help you as well: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/pittsburgh10:37AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I can get some info on archived papers via the Post-Gazette's web sit.  I really appreciate your ""leg work"" here--it should prove helpful.  You've given me some great leads.10:37AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Good! Glad to help! If East Pgh has a local Carnegie Library, they may be a good source as well.10:38AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm going to email this chat to myself so I have the sources. Sadly, I don't think EP ever had a Carnegie Library; if they did, it is no longer there.  But I think there is one in the area that may have some info about EP.  Have a great day and thank you again.10:38AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And those 2 articles in America: History and life may also have bibliographies that can lead to other sources.10:38AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're very welcome!10:39AM 95505707870139188665449415@web.libraryh3lp.com: Have a nice day  :)10:39AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You, too! :-)"

So you could go in and reserve a camera, say, if it's checked out.  But it's not guaranteed since we can't make someone bring it back on time.  But Ipads are just first come, first serve.  And the link I gave you will show availability.10:59AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I can't believe there will be a run on Ipads next week, so with so many available now, looks like you should (no guarantees), should be OK.10:59AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If 90% were checked out, might be a different story.11:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And there are even more Ipads available at the E&S library http://search.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Record/145119211:01AM 32644582559029116252387044@web.libraryh3lp.com: The COAC (design career fair) is next week, so I'm thinking ipads will be a popular item to show of portfolios.

I'm wondering if day 1 of that 7-day loan period would start today or if it would start tomorrow if I checked it out today.11:03AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Note the Hunt and 4th floors are iPad Retina Display (4th generation), E&S iPad 2 if that affects display.11:04AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I believe it would start when you check it out. I can check.11:05AM 32644582559029116252387044@web.libraryh3lp.com: That would be great. Thanks. I would need it until end of day next Friday, so I don't want to check it out too early.11:05AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Loan period would run until 11:59pm next Friday.11:06AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And that's no matter what time you check it out today, it's due next Friday before midnight.11:06AM 32644582559029116252387044@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sweeeet!

If you search from the library's home page using an ""Everything"" search, it will show up in your ""Articles & More"" results.16:53PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Unfortunately, it's a very expensive report that we don't own, but there may be very similar literature out there - I could give you some ideas on where to look.16:56PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I would strongly recommend looking at our Business & Economics Librarian's ""Industries"" guide at:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/industries16:57PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I just got some interesting results in the Frost & Sullivan database that she mentions on her guide by simply searching for ""big data"" (with the quotes).16:58PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Frost & Sullivan will have full text of similar reports.16:58PM 47040211817608875619017872@web.libraryh3lp.com: Wow thank you very much16:58PM 47040211817608875619017872@web.libraryh3lp.com: I will look them up!!!16:59PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Roye is amazing and her guides are rather helpful.17:00PM 47040211817608875619017872@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thank you very much! i just clicked the link and found a lot of market reports17:00PM 47040211817608875619017872@web.libraryh3lp.com: I sincerely appreciate your help regarding my request17:00PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I'm hoping that you find some great stuff to review.17:01PM 47040211817608875619017872@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes and this will be definitely helpful for my research! thank you very much for your time 17:01PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're welcome!

It's not exactly cheap-$5,000-8,000, depending on what license you get.  That's the problem with these market research reports on the web, so expensive only businesses can afford them.  I'll send you alternatives next12:46PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Are you in a Tepper class? If so, which one?12:48PM 37463600725907661037219723@web.libraryh3lp.com: I was in a Tepper class ""Marketing Project 45-937"".

You may not easily get to these particular resources when you do the kind of ""search everything."":http://guides.library.cmu.edu/marketresearch12:51PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The databases in Industry overviews might be the most helpful12:52PM 37463600725907661037219723@web.libraryh3lp.com: Do I need to go into each of the database to do the search? or there is a place that I can search all the databases at once?12:54PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No, you can't search them all at once since they are from different db producers, have different interfaces, etc. Reading the descriptions may help you decide which ones to go into. Also, in some of the ""bibliographic databases"" (have articles, not data), like Businesss Source Premier, you may find synopsis or information from the market research report you first asked about.12:55PM 37463600725907661037219723@web.libraryh3lp.com: oh ok.12:56PM 37463600725907661037219723@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thank you for your help!

All the dbs listed on the guide, too, are in our db list.  Go to homepage, Search and Find, Research Databases, ""b"" for Business source premier. You can also sort all our dbs by subjects.  12:59PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You might also consider the keyword ""cobots.""12:59PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Lastly, you can always make an app't with the business librarian, Ryan Splenda.13:00PM 37463600725907661037219723@web.libraryh3lp.com: ah-ha, found it.

If time is of the essence, we could check at Pitt for it (and hope it's not in storage).14:04PM 05980929534567070936659472@web.libraryh3lp.com: OK, thanks. Time is of the essence (of course) and, also, I am traveling so only a scanned version would be useful. That sounds kind of improbable, but if you would like to check, that would be wonderful. 14:05PM 05980929534567070936659472@web.libraryh3lp.com: And actually, if they do have it, I would love a copy of the whole issue, not just that one article ...

Hopefully the Hillman Library would have the machines necessary to read/print the microformat.14:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Or, Interlibrary Loan might be best.14:12PM 05980929534567070936659472@web.libraryh3lp.com: How should I go about doing that? I have a couple of books from them, but I don't know that I've requested something in microformat.14:13PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You would have to visit Pitt's Hillman Library in person.  If you use Interlibrary Loan, you would likely receive the article via email.14:14PM 05980929534567070936659472@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'd like to do the Interlibrary Loan. Do I do that through you, or can I do it myself? 14:15PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can do that yourself.  I'll send you the link to sign up for a free account - and the vast number of ILLs are no cost to you.14:15PM 05980929534567070936659472@web.libraryh3lp.com: That's great, thanks.

I believe on our homepage she searched ""everything,"" which would pull up articles (they appear on the right side of the screen) and books we have (they appear on the left hand side of the screen).

Do you have a hard copy of the book?  Would save a lot of paper?09:50AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No, we don't have it in paper, but you could get it via EZ Borrow in 3-5 days.  If you wait a sec, I can see if it's in a local library (Pitt or CLP) where you could walk to and get.09:51AM 32217334560643671117968890@web.libraryh3lp.com: That would be wonderful--thanks so much!09:52AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No, sorry, not many have the paper and no one nearby.

You can read the e-book online or download it (and save/print)09:55AM 32217334560643671117968890@web.libraryh3lp.com: I need it this weekend to work on a paper for a class.

Italian immigrants (women) in particular09:55AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Sure-just a minute let me try some keywords09:57AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Italian American women (this is a really specific search) 09:57AM 32217334560643671117968890@web.libraryh3lp.com: My instructor use quotation marks and plus signs and came up with a bunch of stuff.09:57AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: italian immigration  (broader search, but you'll still get relevant info. Even though women may not be in the title, chapters, etc. may deal with them)09:58AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: quotation marks around two words will get you that exact phrase. 09:58AM 32217334560643671117968890@web.libraryh3lp.com: OK, so that makes sense.  And the + sign would be all the words you do a search on?  Sounds, great--thanks very much for your help and time.

Just a moment!11:24AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: kind thanks11:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Are you looking for a score or audio recording?11:26AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: looking for the score11:26AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay--just a moment.11:28AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: so I think I've found it on WorldCat11:28AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: but I can't figure out how to access it11:28AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Do you have that link?11:29AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: oh here's the link11:29AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: http://www.worldcat.org/title/heavenly-light-chorus-for-mixed-voices-a-cappella/oclc/17883377?ht=edition&amp;referer=br11:29AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: perhaps this is interlibrary loan only?11:30AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This particular version would be an interlibrary loan, as it doesn't appear we have it. It's possible that the score is accessible through a database we have access to, but it will take me some time to look into this, as music is not my expertise!  11:31AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can also contact our music librarian directly for help. 11:31AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Her name is Kristen Heath and her email address is kheath@andrew.cmu.edu.11:33AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This page of the research guide provides sources for scores online:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/music/scores11:36AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: many thanks11:37AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let us know if we can be of further assistance.  After a little more searching, it does appear that this will be interlibrary loan request.  11:38AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you need help with making that request, just let me know.11:41AM 92774403225070663658050560@web.libraryh3lp.com: thanks for all your help"

But the 820 number is showing as a previous ID. So what you are saying is that the catalog is somehow overriding your correct log in?12:36PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, I believe 820 was a previous CMU ID that I had prior to 2012, before I rejoined as a student in 201412:36PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: When I try to log on with my andrew ID, it fails, and the form is pre-filled with the 820 number12:37PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Here's an idea. Why don't you try the old login 820171257 and use 1257 as the pin. (Unless that is what is failing...)12:38PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sure12:38PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Let me try that now12:39PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: When I try to use the 820 number with that PIN, I get the same failure message: ""We cannot log you in at this time. Please try again later.""12:40PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Once I try the 810 number, I can log in successfully.12:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It does allow you to type in a new number?12:41PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, the screen it sends me to after I enter my Andrew login looks like a library login page, with fields for ""Carnegie Mellon ID"" and ""PIN""12:42PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: The fields are pre-filled with the old 820 number12:44PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Here is a screenshot of the page I see after I enter my andrew login details: http://dellin.net/box/library-login-fail.png12:45PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Note that it is pre-filled with the old 820 ID number12:45PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: At which point have you tried with your NEW 810 number? At this screen?12:45PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, if I enter the new 810 number here, and the new PIN, then I can log in successfully12:46PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: So it isn't really a problem, I can use everything, it's just annoying that I have to get my ID card out every time (-:12:46PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: OK. I understand. It does the same thing for me -- but my ID number works! Out of curiosity have you cleared your cache or tried a different browser? 12:47PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, I've tried different browsers on different computers as well.12:48PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It is indeed annoying. I can ask someone how to reset that login info -- would you like me to email you?12:48PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, please!12:48PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: I appreciate it12:48PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Again, it isn't urgent -- it's been like this for a while now12:48PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: OK. I will see what I can find out.12:49PM 41723627002605765198570059@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thank you so much!12:49PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You are welcome."

You'd need to go down there, get a guest id  and read online14:54PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Or, what you could do is interlibrary loan14:54PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Fill out a form, we'll find a copy for you and borrow it for you14:55PM 18472684185999843002994101@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok, just have two quetsions14:55PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Sure-14:55PM 18472684185999843002994101@web.libraryh3lp.com: How long would it take if I fill out the form today? and14:55PM 18472684185999843002994101@web.libraryh3lp.com: As a postdoctoral fellow, how long would I be able to keep the book?14:55PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: probably a few days to a week. All depends on workload at both libraries, if book is avialable, etc.  Also, if they have paper copy.14:56PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I think loan period varies by library, but usually at least 3 weeks, and you usually can renew.14:56PM 18472684185999843002994101@web.libraryh3lp.com: Great.

Nice to meet you too :) My name is Vaasavi.09:29AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: :)09:30AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: So, you were able to find the list of countries that changed to fixed exchange rates in an IMF report?09:30AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And you need to figure out when they changed over?09:31AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah, I was. If you'd like, I can either link you the report itself, or send you over the list of countries09:31AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: That would be great! I was going to ask about the IMF report and if I can see it.09:31AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/nft/2014/areaers/ar2014.pdf09:32AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I'm thinking that there may not be a one-stop solution to finding out this information.09:32AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: Page four is what I'm using; specifically looking at exchange rate anchors but stopping at the stabilized arrangement; crawling peg is not what I want09:34AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay. Have you found that the fixed exchange rate is set up or determined by a larger body or organization? Or is this done more on an individual government basis?09:35AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Forgive me, this isn't exactly my area of expertise :)09:35AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: It depends. So the bolded acronyms are names of currency unions--those would be larger bodies that determine the fixed rates. Otherwise, it happens on an individual government basis09:35AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: And no worries, it's not even my thesis advisor's expertise haha09:37AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, lol. Well I would probably have to do some additional digging into this myself.09:38AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I would imagine that some of the places to consider this type of information are the IMF (which you have identified). I'm wondering if there would be some information from the World Bank's perspective as well09:39AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Would it be possible for us to meet sometime to further go over this?09:39AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: I would really appreciate that! When would be best for you?09:39AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: And I'll look into the World Bank some more; the IMF has a dataset (I think) but it's stuck behind a paywall09:41AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, that's good to know.09:42AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Just an FYI, we have the International Financial Statistics of the IMF listed on our research databases list through the library. I can't remember if we have backdoor access to some of the data sets that you are interested in, but it may be worth taking a look at that as well.09:42AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Here is our listing: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?q=international%20financial%20statistics09:42AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, I was looking for that but I don't think I was able to find it. Thanks for the link!09:42AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Were you accessing the IMF outside of the library?09:42AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: you are welcome!09:43AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah, I was; I was in NOLA for spring break so I was trying to get some work done in the mornings before my friends woke up lol09:43AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: In terms of meeting up. I have consultation hours over at Tepper tomorrow from 2-4PM if you'd like to stop during that time?09:43AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Completely understand, haha09:43AM 27925966226547648934045883@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah, I can do that. I'm free between 2 and 3:30. Where should I meet you?09:44AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Great!

That is a little weird because I was able to click on the DOI link through the library's catalog and got right into the eBook13:00PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: May I ask which DOI link you were using?13:00PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Or which edition of the eBook13:01PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Sure! I selected the link to the 2010 edition of the book and clicked on the DOI link under the word ""Internet""13:01PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Oh! Thank you very much. That link was working13:01PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: What should have happened though is that once you click on that link from off-campus, you should have to log in with your Andrew ID and CMU password as a verification mechanism before gaining access13:01PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Interesting! Let me try the other link to see13:01PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Let me see if I can find where the broken link was in case you need it13:02PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks, that would be great!13:02PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I just tried the other link in that record and it worked too.13:02PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Maybe just a temporary glitch?13:03PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Hopefully so! I clearly remember getting an ""Incorrect DOI"" error page though so I'm thinking there is probably a typo somewhere13:04PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Interesting. 13:04PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let us know if you run into that again sometime...we can fix that :)13:06PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm not sure if this is an error or not, but the address after Link in this entry requires an iLibrary login, and I wasn't able to find CMU institutional access: 13:06PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: http://vufind.library.cmu.edu/vufind/Summon/Record?id=FETCH-LOGICAL-a20440-3836ca74928425a6cc22a6b78db0a124f4faf556c3c2b217dc09cd4f86cbf390313:06PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sorry for the poorly formatted link13:07PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No worries!13:07PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This looks like a result from the Articles and More option instead of the Books option13:08PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: In this case the ""Link"" section does not work, but the ""Full Text"" link next to ""Get It @ CMU"" does13:08PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: After a redirect of course haha13:08PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Fair enough!13:09PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Interesting though, I can let our tech people know.13:09PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for reporting this!13:09PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm trying to remember what it was that I had searched previously, but I don't want to take up more of your time13:09PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No worries at all. It may have been a result from an ""Everything"" search too, which searches both books and articles13:09PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: If I find the broken link, should I just submit it to one of the emails given?13:10PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: on the Ask Us page?13:10PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: That would work well, and then we can forward it to the appropriate people for fixing :)13:10PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Oh! I found the error page, anyway:13:10PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: http://dx.doi.org.proxy.library.cmu.edu/10.1007/978146143737613:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hmm...I can't seem to see what this DOI is for though13:11PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm going through my history now to see if I can figure out what redirected to it13:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay13:13PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Would it be okay to send that link to one of our email addresses with a short explanation? I have to attend a meeting. Sorry!13:14PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: No worries! Yes, I can do that13:14PM 25209967252724087845436297@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sorry to hold you up!13:14PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No worries at all!13:14PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks again for contacting us :)"

Now I research contact lens materials, and find that ""Contact lens practice"" (3rd edition, Author: Nathan Efron) is a great book for me. How can I request this item? Should I use ILLiad or E-Z Borrow?15:07PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hi Geonu!15:08PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for contacting us with your question15:08PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You have already double-checked to make sure that we don't have this book already?15:10PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, I have checked our holdings and it looks like we do not have it15:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: E-Z Borrow would potentially get you the book faster as it searches Pennsylvania institutions for this book15:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You would log into E-Z Borrow, search for the book, and place the request15:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This can be done here: http://library.cmu.edu/using/requesting15:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: ILLiad would take a little longer because we would do the searching for you across the country and try to get the book to you that way15:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You would also log into ILLiad, fill out a form with citation information for the book and place the request that way15:16PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The same link has ILLiad information15:17PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Are you still there, Geonu?15:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Additionally, you may want to reach out to the Liaison Librarian for MSE to see if she could possibly add the book to our collection.15:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Her name is Donna Beck, and her contact info is here: http://library.cmu.edu/about/people/donna-beck15:20PM 05837271062410507185354855@web.libraryh3lp.com: Hi I am here okay If E-Z borrow does not work.

So in that case i need to return it ASAP or after 90 days ?16:44PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Current course textbooks are a problem though.  We try to keep a copy or two to circulate within the library, but that's all.  We really try to collect in digital format now - that goes for all science & engineering books.16:45PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You'd need to return it as soon as practical.16:46PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You could place a hold on it as well - getting it back in about a week and a half.16:46PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If a book is too popular, we will explore getting a second print copy or, more preferably, a digital version.16:47PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Your best person to reach out to with a problem like that will be your liaison librarian.16:48PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: See:  http://www.library.cmu.edu/research/expert16:49PM 08832900459003042458367216@web.libraryh3lp.com: How does a student get to read a digital version of a book ?16:49PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Help me out ...

Not sure what you're question is?15:07PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: But then I click the get it@CMU button15:08PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: and it takes me to a page that says no electronic holdings were found for this journal. 15:08PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Did you do an ""everything"" search?  We may not have all the journal articles that are included in that search.15:09PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you give me the citation I can double check for you.15:09PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Specifically, I was looking for ""The Coroner's Strategies for Announcing Death""15:09PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Just a minute-let me check.15:09PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Although I'd happily accept another good example paper for writing a grounded theory research paper.15:09PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: So in summary I have two questions.15:10PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: 1. Why does the search some times turn up a get it at cmu button but then when I click on it, it doesn't link me to the document?15:11PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: This has happened multiple times before and I'm wondering if the links break and need to be reported as broken or if the search result doesn't mean that CMU has the document and I am misreading it some how.15:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We actually have the full text of Coroner's Strategies for Announcing Death. Put the title in the everything search box. in the results click on Full text.15:11PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: 2.  Can you get me a good example of ground theory research paper? 15:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The CMU button ""get it"" gives retrieval options, not necessarily full text.15:12PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm assuming that the paper I want is a good one but I'm not sure.15:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Is this for interp. and arguement?15:12PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: So I would be fine receiving the paper or another one.15:12PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: not sure what that means.15:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: What class is this for?15:13PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Is this for English, Interpretation and Arguement?15:13PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm a computer science student so I'm working a little outside my expertise on this project and would like the help of an example haha.15:13PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: No. It's not for that class.15:13PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm a PhD student trying to write a new computer science theory.15:13PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: OK, thank you.

If the full text is there, there will be the term full text.  CMU Link can show you if the article is full text in other databases, and it can also provide the link to our catalog and our interlibrary loan service.  It will not necessarily have the full text all the time.15:19PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: In the example you gave with the coroner article, there was a ""full text"" link next to the @cmu.  Clicking on that gave me the full text of the article.15:20PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Ah, I see thanks!15:20PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: I had clicked on the citation option without realizing the full text was separate.15:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It can get complicated , but just remember @CMU link is retrieval options.15:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Whenever you see full text-click on that!15:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And if you don't see full text, click on the @CMU get it link15:21PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for the help! 15:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're very welcome!15:21PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Have a good day.15:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You as well-and good luck with your paper!! :-)15:22PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks!

Sometimes db vendors remove the full text of journals. If you are using the databases/resources from our website, the only login should be with your Andrew user ID and password and that is if you are not on a CMU IP address (offcampus, or using laptop)15:24PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We don't have db passwords to even give you-all our authentication for databases, online journals, etc, is either via IP authentication, or login with Andrew user ID and psswd, or using the VPN.15:26PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Will do.  Who should I report that to?15:26PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Remember, you can't just do a google search and then expect to be able to access the full text of an article from a journal (unless it's open access). You need to start with our Library website www.library.cmu.edu and either use the research database links, or the e-journal list.15:27PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can report it here, or you can send mail to any of the ref units- Hunt Library   at huntref@andrew.cmu.edu  or sciref@andrew.cmu.edu for the science libraries15:32PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks. I'll remember to check that before filing a report.15:33PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're welcome.  and we'll be happy to double check any access issue for you.15:35PM 95642615810023341699644973@web.libraryh3lp.com: Have a good day!15:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You as well! :-)"

Usually I beleive people use Adobe to rad/creat, etc. PDFs.  So you may want to make sure it's on your device and up to date.11:53AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you have additional questions regarding this-you may want to contact the science librarians directly-they may have more experience with this since they deal more with Springer. You can email them at sciref@andrew.cmu.edu.  You'll then be able to send a copy and paste of what you see when you try to access the book.12:02PM 30579843176648392135224403@web.libraryh3lp.com: I think you realize I'm not looking at ordinary PDFs.12:02PM 30579843176648392135224403@web.libraryh3lp.com: I got into the Electronic Resource Library which is Web based."

Other than that, there are hearings, with where people give testimony as witnesses before Congressional committees.12:34PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: okay, thanks!12:35PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: Let me review it, and I'll get back to you with better questions12:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We have access to both.12:35PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm really confused!12:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It's complicated, so it's important to know what it is you want-what are you working on?12:36PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: I am tracking Secretary Shultz speeches12:36PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: that would include his speeches before congress12:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It might be helpful to look at a biography or two of Shultz-it's possible there might be some info in the bibliographies about this.12:39PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: thank you12:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: we have this: BOOKAvailableTurmoil and triumph : my years as secretary of stateby Shultz, George Pratt, 1920- Published 1993Subjects: Š—“...Shultz, George Pratt, 1920-...Š—Located: Hunt Library - STACKS-2 (Stacks 2nd Floor) Call Number: E840.8 .S535 A3 199312:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You don't have to read the whole book-look at the table of contents, index, and any special lists of info in the back.  12:41PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok!12:41PM 68214992810609241431091019@web.libraryh3lp.com: thanks, that was very helpful"

I am the Business Librarian and can help12:18PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Probably the best way to go about this is from a company resources perspective12:18PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let me introduce you to a guide that I have created on company research: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/companies12:19PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Great! I searched for such information on Google and something like this would be great, but all the time lines I found a pretty old and only goes until 201112:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No problem. You will probably have to piece together a couple of different resources in order to complete your timeline12:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I don't think that we have one resource that will cover both in one swoop12:20PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: On that guide, take a look at the ""Company Financials"" box12:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There is a resource listed there called Mergent Online12:21PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: select that resource12:23PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: This looks great, the info here is pretty up to date12:23PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Once in it type in Alphabet in the search box (because they recently restructured and that is the name of the ultimate parent company now)12:23PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Oh great! You got in and found Google/Alphabet?12:24PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Click on the ""Equity Pricing"" tab and you can get to current and historical stock pricing data12:24PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes12:24PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can even export this data into excel using the ""Report"" sub tab12:26PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Is there a place that I can find major events? I wish to see the link between the stock change and Google's events, such as the Cloud Next conference last week and the release of Google phone pixel several months ago12:27PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay. The same database has a ""News"" tab as well, but it may not go back as far as you'd like it too.12:28PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Yes, I wish to see some major events maybe range for the whole year of Google12:28PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There is a sub-section within that tab called historical news that gives you some more info12:29PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Also on the main ""Company Details"" tab again, there is a section down at the bottom of that page that gives ""Company News and Corporate Events""12:30PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There is a second database to consider for news as well though12:31PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: The historial news is about acquisitions, would there be some resource for major business events, product release, change in market structure and major players?12:31PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We may have to go the news database route for this.12:32PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Take a look at the ""News Sources and Research Articles"" box within the guide and click on the Business Source Premier databae12:34PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We can search this database for Google/Alphabet  as a ""Company Entity"" and then narrow by publication types after that12:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This is just another potential place to find news because this database has access to newspapers, magazines, and trade publications all from the business discipline12:37PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Is there a tab for ""Company Entity""?12:37PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There is a drop down search filter for company entity12:38PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: next to the search box itself. It defaults to ""Select Field Optional"" but can be changed12:38PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You could also change that drop down to ""Ticker Symbol"" as well if you'd like12:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It looke like company entity is more reliable though12:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: looks*12:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you do go the ticker route, use their old ticker GOOG instead of the new one GOOGL12:40PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thank you very much!12:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No problem!12:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: One last suggestion if you'd like12:41PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Actually, before that...notice that there are additional limiters on the left-hand side of the page within Business Source Premier that you can use to further narrow your search results.12:42PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: For example, Date range, publication type (news vs. trade publication, etc.)12:46PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Is trade publication mainly focusing on the finance?12:46PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It depends, it could focus on quite a few different aspects 12:47PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: They mainly focus on the different industry(ies) that your company of interest operates within12:47PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: But this would be where you could get some nitty gritty info on major events that have happened with Google12:48PM 67597530406307812272236012@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thank you!

It is listed int he ""Company Basics"" box10:39AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It does require an account set up using your CMU credentials, but this is one of the premier resources that we have for private companies (since most, if not all, startups are private).10:40AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: There are some other databases in this guide that may have very basic information on private/startup companies as well.

You need to do interlibrary loan or EZ Borrow from your home institution.  We even tell our own students to use ILL or EZ Borrow when there is a book they want and the only copy we have is in Qatar.09:49AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: I've requested a latest version of this book some 10 days ago through ILL, but still haven't received it.09:50AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: They may be having trouble finding the edition you want or an edition that is available.09:50AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: Is there any fixed time limit within which it is guaranteed to get a book through ILL09:50AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: ?09:51AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: no.  They will usually look until they find it.  There is usually a date on the ILL form after which it says they won't look.  You should talk to your ILL at Pitt about it.09:51AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: And whom should I reach out to, to check the status on the request? The online portal has only been showing 'Request Sent' since the last 10 days09:52AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you are a Pitt student, you need to talk to the ILL office at Pitt, where you placed the request.  If you do not know where that is, ask at  Hillman Library, Univeristy of Pittsburgh.09:54AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can contact the librarians at Pitt via their chat service:09:54AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: http://www.library.pitt.edu/askalibrarian09:55AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: Got it.

Is it same for us?09:59AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You said you were a Pitt student! ""but it'sin Qatar and I'm a Pitt student"" oh-you meant you were Pitt student usually people say Pitt campus-got it. I thought you meant you were a u of Pitt student!! Too many Pitts!!! You can call our ILL office at 412-268-3030. All ILL offices try to get items as quickly as they can. You can also see the status of your ILL.  If you went into your ILL account and saw request sent, that means the request was sent out.  they usually send out a few libraries in the request.  If the first one says no, then it bounces to the second, if the second one won't lend either, then it goes to the third in line.  10:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Even though libraries may have copies, the book may be checked out, on reserve (not available for ILL), etc.  This is especially true of recent books.10:01AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hold it just a minute-I need to check somethign..10:04AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: See if you can get into this link10:04AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/978032155018710:11AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: Hahaha! Yeah I meant Pitt campus. I'm accessing this through CMU library portal and though Pitt would mean Pitt campus when talking about Qatar.10:11AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: I can access the link above. Seems like if I sign in I can go through the ebook10:12AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: Should I use my andrew credentials?10:12AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: great! are you on campus or on the network?10:13AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm at home connected to VPN10:15AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: OK, if you're on the VPN that should work.  I got in and I'm on the network, but I didn't have to login.  I'm not even sure how or why I got in.  We recently got Safari books (collection of e-books), but I searched our collection and didn't see this title. I found this via  the Worldcat database, gave the link a try and got in! Wierd!10:15AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I was just hoping it would work for you.  10:16AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Do you need the whole book or just a chapter?10:18AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: I see a link where it says 'use Safari via Public Library Account' but its not working for some reason. I'll try again from the library network.10:19AM 06010717351903909284283750@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks a lot for the prompt responses.10:19AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/978032155018710:19AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You're welcome!  "

I'm wondering if alumni can gain access to electronic resources, such as journals?16:31PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: You can only do so, by visiting our campus in person and getting a temporary pass issued.  I wish this weren't the case, but we're bound by contract with regard to what we can do.16:31PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: So, if you're on campus we can help you out.16:31PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: Alright.  That's OK16:32PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hopefully your public library has some good digital resources.16:32PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: Well I am in DC, so it doesn't work.  Do you have any other ideas regarding accessing journals?16:33PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It would be worth checking with the local universities to see if they allow visitors temporary access.16:33PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: UDC would likely provide what access they could.16:33PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok16:34PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hmmm ... not sure ... I would think the District has a public library.16:35PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: yes.  but do public libraries have journal subscriptions?16:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It would be worth getting a library card.  Do you live in the district or commute?16:35PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: in dc16:35PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let me check quickly...16:35PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok16:36PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: http://dclibrary.org/      Here is their web site.  Let me look around a bit.16:36PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: alright16:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: At a first glance, I don't see a lot of engineering and science stuff, but other areas seem to be dealt with fairly well.16:40PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: What kind of journals were you hoping to be able to access?16:40PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: more social science16:41PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Ah ... you maybe be better off then ... I would imagine the general public in that area has a stronger interest in social science than the normal community.16:41PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: i'm not seeing on their website how to access journals16:41PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Take a look at their list of databases.  Some will have full text journals within them.16:42PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I haven't found direct access either.  I'll keep looking.16:51PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: hold one ... info coming16:51PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok16:53PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I just got off the phone with the DC Public Library ...16:54PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: They do have access to a couple of databases that we felt might be a good match for your needs.  I'm hoping that you'll be able to access them remotely with your library card number (if you don't have one, they're easy to get).16:54PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The first would be Expanded Academic ASAP.  16:55PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It's a lot like the ProQuest database that we had at Carnegie Mellon.16:55PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok16:55PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The other that I spotted was Social Sciences Full Text.16:55PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: nice16:56PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: this is helpful, thanks16:56PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: From there home page ... use the Research tab and choose databases. Then you can apply the Social Sciences filter to locate the Social Sciences full text database quickly...16:57PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We found Expanded Academic ASAP under the ""General Reference"" filter.16:57PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: great16:58PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Also, if you know particular journals that you're interested in, use the WorldCat database to locate libraries in the DC area that would hold them.16:58PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: That might help you to locate an academic library that is convenient to you that allows local on campus visitor day passes.16:58PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: cool16:59PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The public library can likely get you a lot of stuff via Interlibrary Loan ... but there might be a charge.16:59PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: good idea17:00PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Is there an academic library near where you work or live?17:00PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: yeah, there are several.  i was hoping to be able to remotely access journals.  i guess the interlibrary loan is an ok idea17:01PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: hopefully the dc library will work17:01PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Remote access to the public library is common.  Unfortunately the academics will be restricted in what they can provide via contract.17:02PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: not following17:02PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Academic library licenses usually state that only current students staff and faculty can have access.17:03PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: right ok17:03PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We pushed the issue a bit by saying that in person visitors temporarily join our community.17:04PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Some universities do pay extra for certain databases for their alumni.  Maybe the alumni group should push for that?17:04PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: would be nice17:05PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I will mention it to our Dean of Libraries.  I'm not sure if they're thinking about it or not, but it can't hurt to know that we have alumni that would like it.17:06PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Is there anything else that I can help you with today?17:06PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: i think that's it.  thanks17:07PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hope the public library databases work out!17:07PM 99866395795953859582611287@web.libraryh3lp.com: me too"

However, we do have access to some reports and databases that have a lot of this type of information.11:49AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I'll send you a link in a moment to a research guide that might be helpful.11:49AM 44174497313332457889536226@web.libraryh3lp.com: cool11:50AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This guide gives you a great overview of all of the business resources we have:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/tepper11:52AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This might be a more targeted search strategy to try in some of the databases:  ""office 365"" AND (""pricing strategy"" OR ""licensing strategy"")11:53AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: ABI Inform and Business Source Complete are two databases that might be helpful.11:54AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Or you can broaden the search to:  ""microsoft"" AND (""pricing strategy"" OR ""licensing strategy"")11:56AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This article is a bit old but might be useful:  http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=buh&AN=43233191&site=ehost-live11:57AM 44174497313332457889536226@web.libraryh3lp.com: could not open last link11:57AM 44174497313332457889536226@web.libraryh3lp.com: can you share in pdf? 11:58AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: It's from 2009--here's the abstract: 11:58AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The article examines the pricing policies undertaken at Microsoft Corporation, the developer and manufacturer of computer software.

Let me see what info I can get from Penn State's system.  Usually if a library has a digital copy, unless we do interlibrary loan, you'd have to go to that university to use it.  There's no way you here @ CMU would be able to use a digital copy @ PSU  (unless you knew someone there and they gave you password or sent you copy, etc.).14:10PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: yeah that's what i'm trying to do14:11PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: i have a good friend at caltech and uc irvine that could possibly do that for me14:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No going to work....PSU's is a paper copy that is in their offsite repository, so it would have to be requested from there Proceedings of the 2001 Bioengineering Conference: presented at Snowbird, Utah, June 27-July 1, 2001by Kamm, Roger D2001Conference Proceeding:Submit Request for Annexed Material, R856.A1B43 v.50, Annex (UP) 14:11PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Oh-let me check for Caltech14:12PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Libraries in CA that have it: Stanford, UC Davis, UCLA14:12PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: do you know if its digital or hard copy?14:14PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: UCLA paper14:15PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Stanford paper offsite storage14:16PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: UC Davis paper14:19PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: oh boy haha14:19PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: i don't think that's going to work then14:19PM 37634117905240787363791496@web.libraryh3lp.com: alright, i'll try to ILL then.

This is how it works: Your request goes on the bottom of our pile, and then goes out to library and goes on the bottom of their pile.  They have to get it from offsite (if PSU), copy it, then send to us.  I have no idea how big ILL piles are now (desperate students in same situation as yourself)...and how many staff are on vacation, out sick, etc.  It's so hard to give exact times.

There is no work listed that appears similar in content based on the titles. 13:56PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: As you may know, this is often the case with psychology conference findings, a conference presentation often reflects work in progress which may not ever be published in a peer reviewed journal. 13:57PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If you are very keen to know the results of this work I would suggest contacting the authors to ask if they have any record of their findings, however given it was more than 30 years ago you may not have much luck. 13:57PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I'm sorry I wasn't able to help further.

I really don't want you to spend a lot of time on this if you don't think it will turn up anything, so if nothing seems to be out there, no need to dig too deep!08:59AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I was able to find this summary or a larger Gifting Market report by a company called Unity Marketing. It may not have the exact figures you are looking for, but does give an overview of the market as a whole. I'm attaching it now08:59AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No worries! I have no problem looking into this a little bit. 09:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Unfortunately, we won't be able to get that entire report from Unity Marketing because we don't subscribe to their product.09:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I can give you a couple of other resources to check as well09:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for the contact info!09:00AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: Ok great.09:00AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: &amp; Thank you!09:01AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: :)09:01AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: My name is Ryan by the way...pleasure to meet you virtually09:02AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Another resource that may turn up some stats on this is called Passport: http://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php?s=100438&q=passport09:02AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: They focus on a lot of consumer product market research. There may be an article/report of relevance09:03AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sorry, I was checking out that report!

Thanks!09:05AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Great!09:06AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Here's another quick summary of the ""e-Gifting market"" as well. May contain some useful info: 09:14AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Still looking around in some other resources. Thanks for your patience09:15AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: No problem, thank you!09:15AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: These are all really cool reports.09:20AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Good deal! Glad they are helpful. Okay, I was able to find one very large report that we subscribe to that has a short chapter devoted to gift giving. It looks like there are some useful statistics within it as well...especially some wedding-specific content09:20AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The problem is that we can't download just that short chapter...have to download the whole thing.09:20AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I can try and send it over this chat mechanism and we can see if it works09:22AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If that attachment did work, the Gift Giving section begins on pg. 20509:23AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: That works. Wow.09:23AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm amazed that the industry puts all these together.09:23AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Great!09:23AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: So much information!09:24AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah we have some pretty decent resources.09:24AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: The problem with this industry is that it isn't as cut and dry as some of the others...so finding some of those particular statistics become difficult09:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Hopefully, these have helped a little. I do have to run at the moment because I have another appointment coming up at 9:3009:25AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: Ok thank you so much for all the help!09:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I can continue to do a little digging if you'd like?09:25AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No problem at all! My pleasure :)(09:26AM 22249375476414801070802790@web.libraryh3lp.com: If you have some free time, I would absolutely appreciate it. If not, the information you gave me thus far is great! Either way, have a nice day, Ryan!09:26AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay, sounds good. You have a wonderful day too, Julian!

I'm a doctoral student and this is just one of a many ongoing projects I am working on (and it is in the very early stages)!09:30AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Okay great! Sounds good.

(Their prof is an alum from GT Law &amp; he wants to introduce them to a law library/legal research.)09:30AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: hi09:30AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: I noted that Carnegie Mellon has ProQuest Congressional - does that include Legislative Insight?09:31AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: If so, I'd like to show them how to use it for legislative history research &amp; let them know they have access to it &amp; help using it at Carnegie Mellon.09:32AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: No, I don't believe it does-it's ""just"" Proquest Congressional-hearings, legislative history, 09:32AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: ok - that's still really helpful for leg research!09:33AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I did make a guide for policy research-let me see if it helps identify what we have in that area.  I just discovered the subject category we made in our A-Z database list Law/Legal has disappeared....something to investigate after this chat!!~09:34AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: lol - that always happens!09:34AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: If this helps (it may not, more policy): http://guides.library.cmu.edu/policyanalysis09:34AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'll be happy to include whatever is avail at Carnegie Mellon for them09:36AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We have HeinOnline databases ...you know, if you give me your email, I'll be happy to note what we have in this area and do screen shots-chat doesn't let me do that. 09:37AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Sure - roj2@georgetown.edu Rachel Jorgensen09:37AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks for your help!09:37AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: This way you could get a really clear idea of what we have (e.g. which HeinOnline dbs), etc. Thanks so much!09:38AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: That's perfect!  09:38AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I think it will be the easiest way! Hope it helps! :-)09:41AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: While we don't have a law school, we do sometimes get law questions, we also rely on U of Pitt's law school library down the street.  We don't have WestLaw, for example.09:42AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: That's good to know - I'm going to explain how proprietary the law databases are09:45AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Yeah...really!! LOL!!  I've just sent you email with our law/legal resources, with screen shots so you can see what they actually have access to.  09:45AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: We have laws, hearings, really don't have cases per se.09:47AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Got it! They should have more than enough access for what they're working on -09:49AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Great!  And while I'm sure they can get access to better stuff there, just as an FYI, all can access these databases remotely-we use EZ proxy so they just need to logon with their Andrew user IDs and passwrds.09:49AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Just curious, Rachel, which prof is this?09:50AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Fred Crawford09:50AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: I'm not sure if he's an adjunct09:51AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Don't know him....ah-there he is in our directory-staff with our CMU Washington Semester Program! 09:55AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: This is the first time we've gotten this request09:57AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: And this is the first time we've gotten any type of question re the Washington Semester program.  I sent you an email with ways they/you/etc can contact us-chat (duh) we also have a reference email huntref@andrew.cmu.edu and while we don't have a librarian liaison to that particular program, they can also email me if need be.  We're happy to help whenever we can.09:59AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Great!  I'll let you know how it goes (scheduled for next Monday evening) 09:59AM 02096449789118397066477950@web.libraryh3lp.com: Hopefully it will encourage them to work with you all10:00AM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Awesome!

This will give you a quick snapshot of the total paved vs unpaved roadways 14:52PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Again it's just a quick figure, but could be useful in an overview14:53PM 35829954815778616206390725@web.libraryh3lp.com: Okay I just saw it. That helps. We can do a ratio of paved to unpaved roads as an overview14:53PM 35829954815778616206390725@web.libraryh3lp.com: Thanks once again14:53PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Right, that's what I was thinking as well.

When you're in a library database, it's easy to save records to them.

For reference, I put together a guide on standards at the university at:  http://guides.library.cmu.edu/standards   I hope you find it helpful.

The chat has been inactive for quite some time, so I'm going to close the discussion.  You can reach me at matthewm@andrew.cmu.edu if you need to discuss obtaining standards.  I did note an IP address that is not affiliated with the university, so it's possible that I won't be able to help obtain the standard if you're not a member of the Carnegie Mellon University community.

A bicycle is a non-motorized, man-powered vehicle with pedals and two wheels attached to a frame. Similar to motorcycles, many different types of bicycles exist, such as mountain, hybrid, road, racing and touring bicycles. Bicycle parts sold by the industry include bike frames, drive trains, handlebars, seats and brakes. Many local governments also require features such as lamps, reflectors or warning bells.Over the five years to 2016, sales of bicycles and related parts have risen. Increased health consciousness by consumers have led to rising use of bicycles over the period. According to the Bicycle League, from 2000, bicycle commuting rates have risen by 62.0% in bicycle commuting as more people are biking to work as a way to stay in shape and avoid transportation costs.16:38PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Lots of repeat information.  16:39PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: Let me try another database.16:41PM askandyver2@chat.libraryh3lp.com: I wasn't thinking of high technology.

Response was no such holding. I sought then under title, Artists of the Possible. I found it in the collection with call number, although with author's name listed as Matthew Grossmann, not Matt Grossman. Took the book out, and the book itself, title page for instance, lists author as Matt Grossman. So I'm asking you, out of curiosity, how these two inconsistencies between Cameo and on-the-ground reality may have occurred.

The amount, issue content, and ideological direction of policy depend on the joint actions of policy entrepreneurs, especially presidents, legislators, and interest groups. This makes policymaking in each issue area and time period distinct and undermines unchanging models of policymaking""-- SUBJECT(S) Descriptor: Political planning -- United States -- History.
